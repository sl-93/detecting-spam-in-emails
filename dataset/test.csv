"FROM BONGO WALEJOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.TELL:+27-732112866.Dear sir,I am MR, BONGO WALE, the son of lateMR.PATRICK WALE, who was murdered in a land disputein ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search forreliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidentialfinancial transaction, then I decided to write you. Mylate father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of theruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean oppositionparty. Before the death of my father, he took me to SouthAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars($12m) with a security and finance company, as if heknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money wasdeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid muchdumourage from the security firm.This money was earmarked for the purchase of newmachinery and chemicals for the farms and theestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when President R. MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying in SouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma ofclaiming/investing this amount of money in SouthAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience infuture since both countries have the same politicalhistory. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law doesnot allow such investment hence I am seeking foran asylum or refugee.I must let you know that this business is 100% riskfree and the nature of your business does notnecessary matter. So if you are willing to assist usclaim the ownership of this money,I and my family haveagreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will befor a joint business venture I will be doing with youand another 35% will be for me and my family which weshall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%will be mapped out for all expenses we may incureduring the transaction.Therefor, if you are willing and interested to renderthe needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Faxnumberfor easy and better communication.Remember that this is highly confidential and thesuccess of this business depends on how secret it is kept.Expecting your reply soonest.Best Regard.BONGO WALE_________________________________________________________________Find a friend, companion or lover at the world's largest dating service! http://match.msn.co.za/match/mt.cfm?pg=channel&tcid=1826"

"sbwhoeopSunday January 3 2010 10:01 AMH: They asked for 250 words and I wrote slightly more briefly on China. Sid2010: global cracks human prospects (part II)No•a■iid Hayes 2 January 2010Subjects:• Democracy and government• International politicsMore openDemocracy authors reflect on a volcanic decade in global politics - continued from part IopenDemocracy deputy editor David Hayes asked openDemocracy writers to reflect on the decade that has passed andthe one that lies ahead by considering three questions:1)What was the most significant trend in the century's first decade?2) What do you most hope for and most fear about the decade to come?3) What idea do you see fading and/or emerging in 2010 and beyond?• Sidney BlumenthalThe greatest challenge for the early 21st century is that China's leadership has contempt for much of the internationalorder and many of the international organisations developed since the second world war. In pursuit of its narrow and evencrude understanding of its interest China will constantly abuse and break international rules protocols and bodies. Itswillful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in abeggar-thy-neighbour approach environmental degradation and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generallyare the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism in Africa especially but alsoelsewhere China is able to gain help partly through economic intimidation in its international forays to repel or strikedown the responsibilities of internationalism.Internally China is a prison of nations an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union and may also be themost unequal industrial country in distribution of income. China's power is increasing but the authoritarian regime ishardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers orex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear ofoperating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with realchoice and ultimately of letting go even a little bit).In the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes ofentrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. China's growing economic power is accompanied by expandingarrogance demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there.China's regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity itself based incoherently on recklesseconomic development for example in the areas of currency environment and labour; it has no ""soft power"" not justbecause of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forcesits way through coercion of one sort or another.The next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at arhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase ""strategic reassurance"" was risibleand did not last. For now the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency.The most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vaticanto the Taliban - arrayed against modernity the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States mayeven have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutionalamendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the firstfemale one will not be so great.Sidney Blumenthal is former senior adviser to President Clinton and an Oscar and Emmy award-winning documentaryproducer.

"I know you will be surprised to read from me, but  please consider this as arequest from a family in dire need of assistance.First, I must introducemyself I am MR. TSEPO VUSI from Angola. I am the first and only son of BRIGADIER VUSI  JONES. I  am presently resident in South Africa.I got your contact address from a business directory  in JohannesburgChamber of commerce and Industry. On  behalf of my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETHVUSI I  desided to solicit for your assistance to transfer  the sum of US$21.5MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)inheritedfrom my late father, into your personal company's account.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in  charge of Arms andAmmunation procurement for the Angola  Army. In his WILL, he specificallydrew my attention  to the said sum of money which he deposited in a  safe box ofa private Security Company in Johannesburg-  South Africa in a treasure box,fully documented in  my name.IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE  MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOURATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITYCOMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATEDAND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITHGOVERNMENT FUNDS AND  PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUETO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNEDBY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THISAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUMOF US$21.5 MILLION. IN  CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATHONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENT  PURPOSES.>From the above, you will understand that the lives  and future of my familydepens on this money, as such I  will be grateful if you can assist us. We are nowliving in South Africa as political Asylum seekers and financial laws andregulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to suchhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hencei am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set asidefor local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once wehave established  trust and confidence between ourselves. Please treat thismatter as very urgent.Best regards,TSEPO VUSI"

"PIR <preinesMonday August 16 2010 11:48 PMHuma Abedin; CDM; Jake Sullivan""minister in a skirt""http://mobile.nytimes.com/a rticle?a=644869North Korea Takes to Twitter and YouTube By CHOE SANG-HUN The New York Times August 17 2010SEOUL South Korea - North Korea has taken its propaganda war against South Korea and the United States to a newfrontier: YouTube and Twitter.In the last month North Korea has posted a series of video clips on YouTube brimming with satire and vitriol againstleaders in South Korea and the United States.In one clip it called Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a ""minister in a skirt"" and Secretary of Defense Robert M.Gates a ""war maniac"" while depicting the South Korean defense minister Kim Tae-young as a ""servile dog"" that likes tobe patted by ""its American master.""Such language used to be standard in North Korea's cold-war-era propaganda. Its revival is testimony to the increasedchill in relations between the Koreas in recent months.In the past week North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok or ""our nation.""Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named ""uriminzokkiri."" The Web sitewww.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea a propaganda agency inPyongyang.Lee Jong-joo a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul said ""It is clear that these accounts carry the samepropaganda as the North's official news media but we have not been able to find out who operates them.""The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korearesumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships killing 46sailors.North Korea which denies involvement has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter andYouTube with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outsideworld.)""YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda"" said Paik Hak-soon an analyst at SjongInstitute. ""But fundamentally it's not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash outdesperately in the face of mounting international pressure.""During the cold war era South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years agoduring the brief era of its ""sunshine policy"" of engaging the North the South allowed its people access to North KoreanWeb sites. But today when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account agovernment warning against ""illegal content"" pops up.These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their ownopinions about the totalitarian North.But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinkingof the South Korean warship including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in theSouth.The Twitter account which provides links to the North Korean Web site had 928 followers as of Monday. But a fewYouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views.In one such clip North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan the South Korean foreign minister who recently criticized ""pro-North Korean youths"" who voted for the opposition in the June local elections saying ""If they like the North so muchthey should go and live under Kim Jong-il.""The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a ""pro-American flunky"" and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living ""mopping the floor of thePentagon.""Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the ""American imperialists"" because it was armedwith nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche or ideology of ""self-reliance""; and because of a philosophicaltreatise written by Kim II-sung the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il who died in 1994.""I don't think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans"" said Yoo Ho-yeolan expert on North Korea at Korea University here. ""People watch this for fun not to be influenced."""

For your clarification and understandin=g,this money is in a truck box which was deposited with a security companyindisguise as a family treasure DIAMOND AND GOLD since 5th of May 1999.it is not an ill gotten wealth rather it was WILLED to me by my late husb=and.On your acceptance to render this assistance to me, I will instruct thesecurity company to effect the change of ownership of this fund to yourname as the bona-fide owner/my next of kin to enable you retrieve the fun=dsince the box can not be moved out of our country by the family's name.It is very important that you forward to me your full name ,your privatetelephone and fax numbers/occupation,to enable me send all relevant docum=entspertaining the deposit of this fund to you. Bear in mind that this transa=ctiondemands absolute confidentiality because all properties,assets and bankaccounts both local and international bearing the ABACHA'S family name,are been confiscated by the Already elected civilian President of Nigeria=so called (President Olusegun Obasanjo)hence I will not want to be expose=dthis is to aviod losing the money.

I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in= African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist sear=ch.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability a=nd reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God= or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ =15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account= that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his enti=re family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next= of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unl=ess somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as= indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that al=l his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the pla=ne crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and r=elease the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased fo=r safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we= don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained= unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank tr=easury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this= business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, an=d a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in r=espect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for =expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woma=n colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursementaccording to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arrang=ed, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the d=eceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private= telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locati=on where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=f the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this trans=action is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear a=s all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon= as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Your's faithfully, BALA TOMSON (Esq.)"

When my late husband wasalive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five HundredThousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe.Presently, this money is still with the Bank and the management justwrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release ofthis money or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody toreceive it on my behalf if I can not come over.Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoingtreatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talkand my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It ismy last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the World.Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth sincemy illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this hugeresponsibility to any of them.Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Standand collect the Funds from the Bank.I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fundchurches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and toensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inheritthis money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't wantmy husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodlymanner.Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid ofdeath hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be inthe bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall holdmy peace.I don't need any telephone communication in this regardbecause of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's relativesaround me always. I don't want them to know about this development.With God all things are possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact ofAttorney who is in Europe as he will be the one to assist you in layingclaims for this funds.Please send all emails to :mothermrsmelissa1@yahoo.gr=20Yours in Christ,=20Melissa Pointer=20God bless you"

"Dear Sir,                                   HIGHLY CONFIDENTIALGreetings.This mail may come to you as a surprise but I plead with you to patientlyread through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not.I wish to solicit for your assistance in the transaction which I stronglybelieves will be of mutual benefit to both of us if treated with trust andconfidentiality that it deserve.My name is Mr. Peter Wang Qin, the branch manager of a reputable bankin Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, in the Republic of South Africa. I andtwo of my colleagues wish to seek your assistance in the transfer of somehuge sum of money into a foreign bank account.This money was deposited seven years ago in a fixed deposit account in mybank by an Oil consultant/contractor with the South African MiningCorporation. (Name deliberately withheld for now) The length of time for thematurity of the fixed deposit was five years, which expired towards theending of last year. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to hisforwarding address but got no reply.After a month, a reminder was also sent and finally we discovered from hisContract Employers - The South African Mining Corporation that the Depositordied from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out thatthe depositor/beneficiary actually died in a car Accident here in SouthAfrica, in May 2000 and he left nobody as next-of-kin to claim this money.All efforts made to trace any known relations of his proved abortive, and noone has written our bank in this regard.Hence, this said money is still lying in my Bank and the interest is beingrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. Now it�s clearno one will ever come forward to claim it. And according to the Laws ofRepublic of South Africa, at the expiration of 5(five) Years, the money willrevert to the ownership of The South African Government if nobody applies toclaim the fund.All modalities for the successful transfer of this money into an offshorebank account have been put in place and we are looking for a trust worthyforeign partner into whose bank account this fund would be remitted to andit is this regard that my colleagues have mandated me to provide a partnerwho will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the totalamount if you should accept to assist us.If you are interested in giving us the required assistance, kindly replythis mail stating your Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because ofthe secrecy surrounding this transaction, l suggests that you contact meonly through e-mail, until further notice.I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you soon. Feel free to askany question in this regard.I remain,Yours Faithfully,Mr. Peter Wang Qin"

Attached is the latest version of the speech incorporating comments from Sandy and Strobe as well as edits fromCheryl and Anne-Marie and Lissa.While it has improved it has also grown in length. It is now just a bit shorter than your Senate confirmationtestimony. There are places to cut but I want you to see it in full so you can make your own assessments.John Podesta will send a few additional thoughts later today or tomorrow — the rest of his comments are captured inthis revised text.Dennis is going to sharpen and hone the sections on the Middle East and Iran and I will ask Holbrooke to work on theAf-Pak piece.I am available any time to discuss.142
Thought some more after our conversatiion and have something to discuss that might be useful.Call when you have a chance.Sandy -This is written from my BlackBerry.
Jeff/Harold--I spoke w Kouchener who will be meeting in Paris tomorrow night w Moroccan FM Faris-Firri.

"FROM THE DESK OF.. DR AMIRI BABOBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGERFOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.BANK  OF AFRICA(B.O.A)OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASODear Friend,I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department BANKOF AFRICA .In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$25M US dollars (Twenty five Million  US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2002 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next if kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leavingnobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you so that the money will be released  to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I  propose  that 30% of this money will be for you as my  foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60% would be for me. Thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your  private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and  location wherein the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by e-mail a  text of the application which you'll fill in and send to the bank's email address.. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for further clearifications.Yours faithfully,.

Here is what PJ said on the subject:The Secretary this morning spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu regarding Iran. During the call the Secretarystressed that in our view Iran's recent diplomacy was an attempt to stop Security Council action without actually takingsteps to address international concerns about its nuclear program. There's nothing new and nothing encouraging inIran's recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the internationalcommunity which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to theIAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensifyefforts to apply greater pressure on Iran. That was the primary purpose of the conversation. They briefly touched onother subjects including Middle East peace and the relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan.

"Dear Friend,My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of (Twenty million five hundred thousand u.s dollars)that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 15% for you,then 5% for any expenses insured.God be with you.SALIM IBRAHIM"

On June 6th 1999, a Gold=20Consultant/Contractor with the British National Gold Corporation, Mr.=20Ahmed Yousef Mustafa, a National of Kuwait, made a numbered time=20(Fixed) Deposit for 12 calendar months, value =C2=A312,500,000.00 (Twelve==20Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in my branch.=20On=20maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but=20got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his=20contract employers, the British national gold corporation wrote to=20inform us that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died on an automobile accident;=20that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next=20of kin through the Kuwait Embassy were fruitless.=20At first I was=20surprised that i did not receive much official cooperation in my=20inquiries in order to trace his kin in Kuwait, and inform them about=20Mr. Mustafa deposit of (GBP12.5m) plus accrued interest. I therefore=20made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Ahmed Yousef=20Mustafa hadactively opposed the government of his country Kuwait,and=20was consequently driven into exile. Being a mining expert, he=20subsequently obtained a job with the British national gold corporation,=20and settled in London.=20Thereafter, he walked into my office to make=20the aforementioned deposit of (GBP 12.5m).He did not declare any kin in=20his application paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and wheni=20asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I accepted his=20application because banks are conservative and will always honour a=20customer'swishes, especially high networth customers.=20My proposal=20therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the=20next of kin to Mr.Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation=20to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to=20come from the same country. I have workedout the modalities to achieve=20my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore, also by this means=20transfer this money total =C2=A312.5m abroad for us to share.=20Once you=20indicate your interest, I will initiate the processing of the transfer=20and in about 14 working days the money total =C2=A312.5m will be in your=20nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and=2030% for you.=20Thanks and God bless,Looking forward to your urgent=20reply.Mr.Titus James Morris."

"Slaughter Anne-Marie <SlaughterA@state.gov>Monday November 29 2010 11:31 AMAbedin Huma; Mills Cheryl D; Sullivan Jacob JA Foreign Policy 100 top global thinkers plug for the QDDRFor a tiny bit of good news in such a bleak week you and President Clinton came in at no. 13 inForeign Policy's second annual list of top global thinkers with special commendation to you forlaunching the QDDR (and for cookstoves and women's rights as well as for your strong positionon American leadership). Michele Flournoy and I also tied for no. 74 on the basis of our respectiveroles in the QDR and other reviews at DoD and the QDDR here at State. Here are the write ups13. Bill and Hillary Rodham Clintonfor proving that you don't need to be president to act presidential.FORMER PRESIDENT I NEW YORKSECRETARY OF STATE I WASHINGTONSpeaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in September Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded a confident note:""After years of war and uncertainty people are wondering what the future holds at home and abroad. So let me sayit clearly: The United States can must and will lead in this new century.""Ironically two of the people most crucial to the new global century are the Clintons themselves: the ex-president andthe ex-would-be-president the power couple now defined by their position just outside the highest reaches of power.Except that these days both Clintons are more influential and more beloved than ever. Bill's Clinton GlobalInitiative is starting to feel like a sexier more effective competitor not just to Davos but to the United Nations itselfbringing world leaders together to commit their resources to fighting poverty with market-based technocraticsolutions. As of this summer his foundation had contributed $23 million and countless man-hours to the effort torebuild Haiti. Polls have shown he's a better advocate for Democratic candidates than the actual president and hespent most of the fall stumping for woebegone Dems from Orlando to Seattle.Meanwhile Hillary showed up in one recent poll as the most popular political figure in the United States anaccolade she has earned through a no-drama approach to an array of thankless tasks: brushing off Vladimir Putin'stemper tantrum to reach agreement on nuclear disarmament and Iran sanctions promoting women's rights over theobjections of entrenched traditionalists and launching an innovative effort to bring clean cookstoves to the world'spoorest. But what she has mainly stood for is American competence with her Quadrennial Diplomacy andDevelopment Review a major if unglamorous step toward making U.S. statesmanship a more agile beast. If this iswhat Clinton nostalgia looks like bring it on.74. Michele Flournoy and Anne-Marie Slaughterfor setting the tone of how the United States engages with the world.POLICY PLANNING CHIEFS DEFENSE AND STATE DEPARTMENTS I WASHINGTONBarack Obama campaigned in 2008 on the promise of changing not just the style but the substance of how theUnited States deals with its allies and enemies abroad and the job of figuring out how to enact the changes felllargely to two people in particular. At the State Department Anne-Marie Slaughter director of policy planning isspearheading the department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The review aims to rejuvenatemarginalized civilian agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development preparing for a world inwhich America's worst threats are not great-power rivals but the upheavals associated with failed and failing states.Slaughter's Pentagon counterpart is Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy co-founder of the Center for a NewAmerican Security think tank who articulated a vision for a new Democratic realism in foreign policy that bothcandidates Hillary Clinton and Obama embraced in the 2008 election. In 2010 she oversaw the Pentagon's ownquadrennial review a blueprint that cuts back on big-ticket weapons systems and focuses instead on the immediateneeds posed by today's asymmetrical conflicts. Flournoy has also been a vocal advocate for Obama's Afghanistanstrategy albeit a pragmatic one: ""I don't want to suggest that achieving success will be simple or easy"" she toldthe Senate in February. ""We need to prepare for the possibility that things may get harder before they get better.""Anne-Marie SlaughterDirector of Policy PlanningU.S. Dept(silent of State(202) 647-2972"

I am MR. JAJASHA ALI. the Manager of auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongsidewith him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased forsafety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after I will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number,your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted .On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the payment Agency.

"Dear sir,I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria.Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an oversea agent.I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction.The deal in brief, is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use.For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent.Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction,all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us acquire estates in your country.As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into youraccount, we intend to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen.You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal to me,After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through.If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindlydelete/detroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of personalities involved.Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.Yours sincerely,KAYODE PHILLIP."

We just got a short term extension through the House and Senate.
"My dear friend, I am Thomas Dickson, Bank Manager of the United Bank For Africa, Capetown Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6 1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Ms. Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo made a numbered time (Fixed) deposite for twelve calendar months, valued at US$6,500,000.00 (Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from her contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd that Ms Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that she did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace her next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Ms Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo did not declare any next of kin in all her official documents, including her Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$6,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the South African Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Ms Lori Vanwalters-Arvelo so that the fruits of this old woman's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via email. Thanks and regards, Thomas Dickson. "

"Good Day my dear friend, I wish to request for your assistance in a financial Transaction, I decided to contact you, based on a certain issue that is of paramount importance to me.But most importantly, I want you to show your credibility promise that you will be honest and trustworthy to me during my relationship with you, I am, until recently, a first year medical student at the University of Ghana,West Africa. on the 27th of November 2002, in my home town YENDI CAPITAL DAGBON, NORTHERN REGION OF GHANA, some unknown mub attacked and brutal murdering in my family home with the killing of both uncles and aunts including my sister and brothers most expecially my father who was the key target, king or""lion"" of Dagbon,Ya-Naa, YAKUBU ANDANI II .WELL YOU CAN FIND OUT BY YOURSELF THROUGH(www.bbcafrica.com) search event on the(regicide in dagbon region of GHANA) . Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took place. I equally lost my only sister to the""ABUDU MUBS"".When I got home for the remains of my parents,I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited $17.7M United States Dollars (Seventeen Million Seven hundred thousand USdollars) in a private security firm in JOHANNESBURG. This money, according to the document, was meant for the building of an ultra modern hospital for me by my late father, when I complete my studies.Upon the discovery of this document , I left GHANA in trace of the private security firm, and the safer of my life to make claims for the mentioned money as the only surviving next of kin to my father. But deliberately, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money and decided to invest it with you in your country. I have succeeded in making the people at the security company to believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to it are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it out to your country or through your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education, so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a time that I will be ready to be in need of it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world. Most importantly, I seriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality with the whole transaction.Thanks and may Allah bless and guide you. more details awaits your urgent response.

"AX:&nbsp; 27-76197-0308</DIV>  <DIV><BR>DEAR SIR, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=bsp;&nbsp; STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL <BR>You may be surprised to =recieve this letter from me, since<BR>you don't know me personally.Thus, =I have to introduce<BR>myself.I am MR.Vuyo Gwala ,the first son of Late M=R.Tijani<BR>gwala a farmer and leader movement for democratic<BR>change[M=DC] in Zimbabwe until recently, he was murdered in<BR>the land dispute in= Zimbabwe. <BR>I was furnished with viable information from the<BR>Intern=ational Trade Centre here in Johannesburg and I<BR>decided to write to yo=u. Before the death of my father, he<BR>had taken me to Johannesburg to d=eposit the sum of<BR>USD$15,000,000(FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS=),in a<BR>Security Company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in<BR>&nb=sp;Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new<BR>machines and chemicals for the farms and the esta=blishment<BR>of the new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when<B=R>Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land<BR>Act whic=h wholly affected the rich white farmers and some<BR>few black farmers. T=his resulted to the killing and mob<BR>action by Zimbabwean war veterans =and some lunatics in the<BR>society. <BR>Infact, alot of people have been= killed because of this<BR>land reformed Act for which my father was one =of the<BR>victims. It is against this background, that I and my<BR>family= who are currently staying in South Africa decided to<BR>transfer my fath=er's money to foreign account since the law<BR>of South Africa prohibits =a refugee (asylum seeker) to open<BR>any bank account or to be involved i=n any financial<BR>transaction. <BR>As the eldest son of my father, I am =saddled with the<BR>responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account w=here<BR>this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my<BR>government who are bent on taking everyth=ing we have got. I<BR>am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount =of money<BR>in South Africa for fear of going through the same<BR>experie=nce in future since both countries have similar<BR>political history. Mor=eover,the South African Foreign<BR>Exchange policy does not allow such in=vestment as an asylum<BR>seeker. As a businessman, whom I have entrusted =my future<BR>and of my family in his hands,I must let you know that this<=BR>transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my<BR>family,=all I need you to do for me is to make arrangement<BR>and come to Johanne=sburg -South Africa so that you can open<BR>a non-resident account which =will aid us in transferring<BR>the money into any account you will nomina=te overseas. <BR>This money I intend to use for investment. I have two<BR=>options for you,firstly you can choose to have a certain<BR>percentage o=f the money for nominating your account for<BR>this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me<BR>for t=he proper profitable investment of the money in your<BR>country. Which ev=er the option you want,feel free to notify<BR>me as I have also mapped ou=t5% of this money for all kinds<BR>of expences incurred in the proccess o=f this transaction.If<BR>you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to =give you<BR>20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my<BR>in=vestment in your country. <BR>Contact me with the above telephone number =while I implore<BR>you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this<=BR>transaction. And no matter the level of transaction we are,<BR>you mus=t call me on phone first before sending a<BR>reply.Please, You should kee=p this transaction secret and<BR>confidential. </DIV>  <DIV>Best regards =and God bless <BR>Mr Vuyo Gwala<BR>(For the family) </DIV><p>&#32;=09=09		<hr size=3D1>Want to be your own boss?

"                    INVESTMENT OFFER         Dear Sir,In appreciation of your esteemed contact receivedthrough a reliable source and the choice of yourcountry I wish to introduce myself, I am Mr.JamesKabila the son of the late Democratic Republic ofCongo President Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessedmemory.I know this letter might come to you as asurprise butI honestly do not intend to surprise you.I write this letter in respect of my intention toinvest the sum of US$35M(Thirty Five Million UnitedState Dollars) with you.I inherited this money from mymother. This money was got through the smuggling andsales of Diamond and Timber when my father was thehead of state. My mother though not her legal wifeused her privilege position to engage in the businessof Diamond and Timber since she knows that hersurvival will depend on how much she can get out ofthe privilege situation.   When my father wasassassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguardsLt. Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of sometop army officers that wanted to topple him. I escapedto Madrid, Spain because of the fear that I might bearrested by my half brother Lt.General Joseph Kabilathe present head of state.Actually his mother and mymother are not in the best of relationship because ofwho among them will be the first lady tussle and thisultimately affected us their children.My motheradvised me to leave For Madrid, Spain where thesefunds were deposited for safe keeping with a PrivateSecurity Company here in Spain.On getting to  Spainwhere I have been living since then as a politicalrefugee, I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who cancome down to Madrid, Spain for a meeting and to clearthe funds in his name as the sole beneficiary of theConsignment as I was afraid of being defraud. HonestlyI contacted you because I don't want to invest thismoney in Madrid Spain due to my status here as apolitical Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want totake risk because this money is all that my Mother andI are depending on. My step brother Joseph,who is nowthe present leader of my country has seized all myfather's assets and money. He left us empty handedwithout knowing about this funds deposited with theSecurity Company here. That is why I decided thatinvesting this money abroad should be the bestinvestment for me. I will be honored if I can be giventhe privilege of investing this money with you. Iexpect you to be trust worthy and kind enough torespond to this distress call to save My Mother and Ifrom a hopeless future. And if you agree, I herebyagree to compensate your sincere and candid effort inthis regard with 15% of the total amount of $35million US Dollars. When the money ($35 million) ismoved into your discrete account. You will be allowedto draw 15% in your favor, while the remaining 85%will be invested meaning fully for our future ifpossible in your area of business and differentsectors of the Economy in your country which aredividends yielding.Whatever your decision is pleasereach me immediately,and keep this letter tight secretfor the interest of my Family.Best regards, Mr.James Kabila. ___________________________________________________Yahoo!

"AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarksBy: Associated PressNovember 21 2012 07:03 PM ESTU.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya andthree other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subjectto review and updates.She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who has been critical of her but said ""some of the statements he'smade about me have been unfounded but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discussall of this with him.""Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widelydenounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.11 2001 terror attacks on the United States and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place onthe anniversary.The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President BarackObama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton who is not expected to stay on during his second term.Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: ""As a senior U.S. diplomat I agreed to a White House request toappear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day which at that time wereprimarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities Americandiplomatic facilities around the world and Iran's nuclear program.""Hours before the Benghazi violence a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens foreign service officer Sean Smithand two former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.Rice said ""The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this"" pattern.""When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi I relied solely and squarely on the information provided tome by the intelligence community"" she said.""I made clear that the information was preliminary and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers""she added.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739811Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

FYI — from Morningstar:The Turkey-Azerbaijan Agreement was not signed last week in spite of both leaders having said that it would be.Erdogan and Aliyev are now saying June 7 or 8. We have learned that a serious commercial arose that needs to beresolved. I hope it will be but am making no predictions. One could also speculate that Medvedev's visit to Turkey mayhave been a factor. S should be aware of this. Thanks... Dick

"My dear friend, I am Mr. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger Scott made died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Scott made did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Scott  so that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.Thanks and regards.Mr. Yetunde Bassey"

No longer.""Steinberg will meet Wednesday with Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.""The inclusion of Steinberg suggests that the department is aware that it needs to do a better job of integratingSteinberg's portfolio into its general communications strategy and show how the leadership of the department acts inconcert.""Jim has always been an integral part of the Secretary's team but we haven't always shown how crucial he is to State'smission"" said Philippe Reines Clinton's communications consiglieri. ""This is a one simple way to fix that.""The Beltway rumor mill often includes gossip that Steinberg isn't happy or that he's not seen as an integral part ofPresident Obama's foreign policy team or that his efforts aren't appreciated.Reines who rarely speaks on the record responded to a question about whether Steinberg is indeed unhappy in thisway: ""I'm not a shrink and I have to confess that we don't sit around in a circle often enough exploring our feelings. Butwhat is crystal clear to everyone is that Jim is smart dedicated and valued.""Steinberg has a been a principal adviser on issues ranging from Iran -- he is the administration's team lead cybersecurityand China (he's been tasked with pressuring China into accepting tougher sanctions on Iran) but his work often goesunnoticed.On Friday he is said to have given a tongue-lashing to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren about thatcountry's actions during a visit by Vice President Biden.When President Obama selected Gen. Jim Jones as National Security Adviser he asked Clinton to make Steinberg herdeputy -- and she did. Since day one prognosticators have been predicting friction between Steinberg and Clintonalthough none has publicly surfaced."

As the conversation with these two ministers unfold you might make the point that we have come a LONG wayon Cuba so far -- and it would be really unfortunate to jam or embarrass President Obama after all the steps he'staken especially since what we are seeking is an entirely reasonable result.Agreeing to lift the 1962 sanction is a BIG step.

"Atten:Nadkov. Dear Sir/Madam, You may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you don't know me in person, but please take this mail into consideration. I am Mr. Nicholas Kular, the son of   late Mr. JOHNSON KULAR, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. Kindly work with me to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death, he had earlier taken  to South Africa the sum of US$ 26.5 Million (Twenty -Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)  which he deposited with a Security Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as VALUABLES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was for purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the ""modus operandi"" adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. Precisely, More than thirty-eight (38) people have so far been killed. Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe'splan. Subsequently, South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing  our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an ""ASYLUM"". As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance, we are offering you 20% of the total sum, 75% for me and my family while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses we may be incured during the course of this transaction. We wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally, all i want from you is assurance that you will not betray my trust. If this appeal  is acceptable to you, please confirm your interest via the above telephone number or better still email. Best Regards. Mr.Nicholas Kular (For the Family). "

"The Palace of King of Ogoni Kingdom, Ogoni Oil producing community, Rivers State Nigeria. Dear Sir, I am Princess IFEOMA , daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonime, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25 years old and studying Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in NOVEMBER27th LAST year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has One Hundred and Five Million  United States Dollars   (USD105,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Bank . He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My moth! er did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father�s properties, companies e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of ! God, you will help us move this money out of the {BANK} to your country where we can invest this money judiciously with you. You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us. PLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible.

FYIFrom Stevens John CSent; Monday April 23 2012 7:00 PMTo; Sullivan Jacob)Cc Cretz Gene A; Fettman JeffreySubject RE: Latest from HRC friendJake- Interesting report. Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinkingand machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadn't heard about ENI-related corruption butwouldn't be surprised.On the federalism issue. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. Acabinet chance won't solve that problem though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters totake on the Bardans. To the contrary it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeidtribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing theirbeloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they aren't alreadydoing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans heldsimilarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentaryelections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection withthose elections and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things hadcalmed down). Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in thecorning months. Of course we and the UN and our other partners should encourage them to do so.- ChrisSBUThis email is UNCLASSIFIEDFrom; Sullivan JacobSent: Monday April 23 2012 5:31 PMTo: Stevens John C; Cr Gene A; Feltman Jeffrey DSubject Latest from HRC friendU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739878Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Let me know your thoughts:SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council as well as the highest levels ofEuropean Governments and Western Intelligence and security services.1.On April 17 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a closeadvisor that he is considering when or even if to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for thegovernment of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership Jalilrealizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technicalexperts. Jaili continues to believe that for the moment the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalistmovement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continuesto complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of noconfidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead according to this source Jalil is consideringdelaying a CiOCISI011 possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual the NTC has been able to reach a temporaryunderstanding with the eastern federalists allowing the separatists to administer their local regions while deferring to theNTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regardingwho has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16 2012no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge and Jalil now believesthey can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular Jalil according to asensitive source is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalistmovement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source el-Keib's future depends on Jalil'sopinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib'scabinet and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused securitysituation in Tripoli. However while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regardingpossible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to theeastern federalists. Unfortunately from Jalil's point of view this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightenedtension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source after reviewing the federalistproblem Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC believes that el-Keib al Juwali OilMinister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTCindividuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of thissource Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms Shamata told Jalil that for the most part theexisting fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political andtribal leaders. However since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration it isdifficult for firms to initiate new projects since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign suchagreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister whoever he is must establish an orderly administrationbefore full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime Shamata warns that his office has foundevidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard he stated that local representatives ofthe Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of thecountry where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans but he believes ENImanagement in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out without additional comment that Ben Yezza is along time senior official of ENI.5. In the opinion this source Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI at leastuntil they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address hisproblems proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.6. (Source Comment: According to this source el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bringorder to the National Army disarm independent militias and establish security throughout the country. The leadingopposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTCmembers will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are providedby members of this Political committee who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the noconfidence vote however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituentassembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739878Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I once asked members of myfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute themoney which I have there to charity organization inBulgaria and Rwanda, they refused and kept the moneyto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, asthey seem not to be contended with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the hugecash deposit of Twenty Eight Million USD that I havewith a finance/Security Company abroad.

"Dear Friend,I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics, which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life, But please treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you in the best of health.I am Mr Denguele Samatigui, the manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless   some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank treasury as   unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effectivecommunication and location where the money will be  transfer.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Mr Denguele Samatigui,"

"Dear Friend. As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Saidi Fatou, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer which was discovered very late, due to my laxity incarrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing Icared for. But now I regret all this as I now knowthat there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars that I have with a Bank in london. I will want you to help me collect this deposit anddispatched it to charity organizations.email me at giversworld@fastermail.com I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.God be with you. Saidi Fatou._____________________________________________________________Get free email address your_name@moldova.com athttp://www.moldova.comYour Gateway to Moldova!_____________________________________________________________Select your own custom email address for FREE!

"sbwhoeopThursday November 5 2009 10:18 AMHFYI: has some valuable info on af/pak. Sidtittp://www.qpi.corn/Ton NewsiAnalvsis/2009111104/Corranentary-Wariords-R-UsitiP1-16551?57351379/ornment- Nanot T i suARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVEUPI Editor at LargeWASHINGTON Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are successful beyond President Obama's wildest dreams -- e.g. theTaliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspireagainst us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer of course is nobecause this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghanexperience speaking not for attribution agreed a stable secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation at leastnot significantly.The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip shown a gazillion timesover the last eight years replete with terrorist ""trainees"" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggypantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels presumably to kill us all in our beds.Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.11 the chances are they have already selected highly motivated brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates ofPakistan's madrassas who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatientmaidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's ""martyrs"" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In factto be inconspicuous they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact those who follow events inAfghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that'swhere al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved toPakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstitutedTaliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004 al-Qaida was not interested in its nowinsecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribalareas is successful al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives arewidely scattered in the Middle East Africa Europe North and South America.As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan Yemen in the vernacular of the intelligence community will do/isdoing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitalswill do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincialtowns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites willdo/are doing it.Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefscompound somewhere near Quetta the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province whichhas 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida centralissuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of ""no more Sept. lls"" what are the UnitedStates and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come theTaliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11 2001 there waspalpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden wasissuing ""too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religiouseducation."" Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost powerand his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizenhas seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. efforthas been plagued by fraud laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among manyothers came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY aFlorida-based company to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo chiefly bullets for AK-47s. Allrequirements for safety inspections mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces were removed. Thus AEYwas able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chineseammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEYand its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.Wherever U.S. inspectors look they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPostreporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are notdisrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul thatreviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.If true the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban tofight the Afghan government.The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. Theseare the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as themilitary takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq andAfghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead Congress in its infinite wisdom afterauthorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.In a country of 175 million a drop in the proverbial bucket."

Mills Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov>Friday October 30 2009 8:47 PMHRE: Your bossLook at you getting big praise — I don't even get that!
"MR CHEUNG PUIHANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG.Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an obscured business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinion.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassemwho was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred, we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.Should you be interested please send me your name,private phone and fax numbers for easy communication,and your current residential address and i will prefer you write me via my private box,{cheungp22@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr.Cheung Pui___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service - http://www.urbantue.de"

With your permission we are changing the statement to spokesman's name rather than yours. Makes it a more genericstatement of U.S. policy and holds you in reserve.We have tweaked the first paragraph to make clear our expectation.On Mexico consensus is that a call is worthwhile but we will get you an updated call sheet that accounts for interveningevents.The remaining Honduras related call sheets are also coming your way.Please let me know if I can help with anything else.
I understand from Joe that you are reviewing the key material for the human rights reports. You might talk to MikeFuchs who I asked to go thru the key reports with a fine-toothed comb.
"nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you.We share the proceeds FIFTY - FIFTY. I would have gone ahead to ask thefunds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line in myinvolvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have thedeposit released to you within a few days.I will simply inform the bank ofthe final closing of the file relating to Hamadi Hashem I will thenofficially communicate with my Bank and instruct them to release the depositto you.

These funds were so staggering that the Emir, my =late husband's father advised him to make silos for the funds. 12 large =overhead water tanks were made in the premises of the Emir's Palace and all =the funds were transferred and stored there.

"Council on Foreign RelationsExpert BriefThe U.S.-China Economic Relationship: Separating Facts from MythsSteven Dunaway Adjunct Senior Fellow for International EconomicsAuthor:Former deputy director of the Asia and Pacific department at the International Monetary Fund. Authorof the Council Special Report Global Imbalances and the Financial Crisis.November 16 2009http://www.cfr.org/publication/20757/uschina_economic_relationship.html?breadcrumb=°/02Fregion%2F271%2FchinaMany myths surround the economic relationship between the United States and China. Four in particular stand out andit is important to identify them as myths to avoid misunderstandings that could adversely influence policy decisions. Thefact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the UnitedStates is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly since China is a major source for U.S.imports U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition the Chinese authorities haveemphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability inChina is bad with adverse implications for the rest of the world.Taken together these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States(or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies especially its exchange rate policy to facilitate therebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake and that is why during his trip to AsiaPresident Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes inChina. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit inPittsburgh in September 2009.Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main ""banker"" for the United StatesChina holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of China's $2.3 trillion in official reserves it is estimated that70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt but it is not America's banker. Nor is theUnited States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries there are otherwilling public and private sector buyers as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although theU.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in theevent that the Chinese reduce their demand the increase in interest rates would likely be small.Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on thereason behind the decision. It would be in China's best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if Chinareduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greaterflexibility in the currency's movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance itseconomy and be able to sustain rapid growth.China is a big customer for U.S. debt but it is not America's banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China tofinance its budget deficits.If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate it will build up large additional amounts of officialreserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities then China will increase itspurchases of assets denominated in other currencies with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative.In these circumstances China would continue to intervene in its exchange market with the central bank buying U.S.dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be anappreciation of the euro. Consequently countries in Europe not the United States would probably be most affected byChina's move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweighthe effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries.Alternatively China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of othermajor currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interestrates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However the U.S.Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent marketdisruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur asubstantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss and arevery unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternativeofficial reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings.Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goodsThis is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover all of the basic types ofmanufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing textiles footwear toys small appliancesetc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitutefor products from China would be higher but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition amongproducers has become fiercer and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers arenarrowing.Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth inChina is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions the country will struggle to meet thisobjective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up.Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive.The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes.The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. Whileno country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure the truth is that if there is no pressure thereis less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China where the authorities are wedded to the status quobecause of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments inChina's exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008 China has reverted tofixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world.Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for ChinaChinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effectson China's growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changesin China. For example concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has beena major factor behind new initiatives to develop China's interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improveconditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment ofmigrant workers). Hence for China instability is not necessarily bad but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability inChina also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on China's growth. Although Chinaaccounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth the country does not generate much demand for products fromother countries given China's large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodityproducers may be benefiting from China's strong growth but overall it is not providing much stimulus for the worldeconomy as a whole so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world.It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chineseauthorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing theChinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of China's economy but this should be done in his private discussionswith China's senior leaders. Multilateral discussions such as those in the context of the G-20 process are a much moreeffective forum for the United States to take a public stance on China's economic policies jointly with other majoreconomies.Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis changes in China's policies are likely tobe delayed and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the bestinterest of China because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth towardgreater reliance on consumption China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting Chinato fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the UnitedStates and other major economies."

"sbwhoeopWednesday September 8 2010 2:35 PMH: First review of your speech. Goad you used Acheson. Sidaary's Homerun of a Speechby Tunku VaradarajanSeptember 8 2010 I 12:16pmClinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8 2010 in WashingtonDC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obamaadministration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her ""new American moment""—and why she'sbetter than her boss.Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firmunfussy deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world.In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense) the speechWednesday morning by Hillary Clinton delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations was the first time we have beengiven an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was by far the best speech of this administration. Whereasher president has frequently wrung his elegant hands doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders thatAmerica is a cuddly bunny at heart the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living ""a new Americanmoment—a moment when our global leadership is essential."" There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; therewas instead a promise that ""we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home andabroad.""What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillarywould have made a much much better president than Obama.Try this for size: ""The United States can must and will lead in the new century."" In order to do that Clinton promised ""anew global architecture"" ""built to last and withstand stress."" And in a muscular departure from the way in which thisadministration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of Americanvalues she uttered these plainspoken unadorned words: ""Democracy needs defending.""XHuman rights too came in for a robust airing: China was scolded and exhorted to follow ""the rules of the road"" in itsaspiration to be a great power; as was Russia for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolarworld but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals.Clinton used phrases like ""American might"" words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—wordsthat we've come to believe that many Democrats can't bear to voice. How refreshing therefore that she should reach intoa vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for ""good old-fashioned diplomacy"" andthere certainly was an air of the Achesonian of the statesman about her speech. Good old-fashioned diplomacy itshould be noted is in contrast to Obama's apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other only a bitbigger richer and better-armed. Clinton's ""old-fashioned"" diplomacy is based by contrast on the unquestionable premisethat America is the world's leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus.In her speech Clinton referred to the sources of ""American might."" The first of course is ""economic power."" But it is herhailing of the second—America's ""moral authority""—that was so invigorating.It was Acheson who said: ""The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of stateis that they both understand who is president."" What is so piquant here in this administration is not the fact plain tobehold that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a muchmuch better president than Obama.Tunku Varadarajan is a national affairs correspondent and writer at large for The Daily Beast.

"STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Sir                         PARTNERSHIP IN BUSINESS  After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward to you this proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of US$40.5M (forty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) only into his account.  This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by us under the budget, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed. Commissioned, the contractor has been paid his actual cost for the contract. We are now left with the balance of US$40.5M as the over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our own use.  But under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate or own a foreign account. This is why I contacted you for assistance. We have agreed that you will be entitled for 30% of the total sum, 60% for us while 10% for any expenses incurred while transacting the business and whatever left from the 10% will be shared equally.As you may rightly want to know I got your address from our Chambers of Commerce and Industry. I am a top official with the Ministry of Petroleum Resources (MPR). We the officials involved in the deal have put in many years of services to our ministries. We have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us, this is a lifetime opportunity we cannot afford to miss.

Here is the situation as I understand it.The film festival returned funds that it had received from the Israeli Embassy after protests from some UK film figures(Ken Loach) and Palestinian solidarity groups.The Israeli director is now being funded directly by the festival.The organizers issued a sort of apology today.We have not been able to locate any State Dept response to similar episodes in the past (Israeli academics disinvited toa British conference).

"Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR. MARK ELLIS, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER of the CITY CENTER TRUST BANK.I have an obscured business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I did not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium, sorry my English is not very good. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client MAJOR FADI EL AMIN who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ten millions United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several Notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that MAJOR FADI EL AMIN did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.

This is by virtue of its nature CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though know that the transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.

If after going through this email you do not find it interesting please disregard it and send me a formal response. I was a member of the Abuja National stadium building and organizing Committee of the just concluded ""ALL AFRICAN GAMES"" which was organized and hosted by Nigeria but before now I have been a director of sports in the Federal Ministry of Sports and Youth Development. We were appointed over 3 years ago to supervise the building of the ultra modern Abuja National Stadium, putting in place all equipments needed for the completion of the stadium which is acclaimed to be one of the best in the world today and also involved in the planning and hosting of the games. This project cost the government of Nigeria Millions of dollars.The stadium project has been completed; all equipments put in place and Commissioned and used for the All African Games tagged ""ABUJA 2003"". The accounts have been rendered to the government satisfactorily and we have received commendations for a job well done. During the construction, planning and execution of this project, as the Chairman of contract award committee I was able to make some money for myself through contract that was awarded to Dewolfgang Gmbh, which I over-invoiced to the tune of USD18.5M with the help of Dewolfgang Gmbh the original contractor. All I want you to do is to assist me in clearing this amount while standing in as the owner and director of Vacknol Nigeria International Limited in whose name I made as the beneficiary of the funds. Vacknol Nigeria International Limited is an international company and could have a company anywhere in the world the most important thing been that it is registered here in Nigeria as a limited liability company in line with the company and allied matters decree of Nigeria which I have since done, I have also in my possession some contract document which will act as proof that Vacknol Nigeria International Limited executed the contract as a sub contractor under the Dewolfgang Gmbh who is the major contractor that executed the contract that was over -invoiced. On the payment of this money to you as the supplier in the name of Vacknol Nigeria International limited because I will apply for the transfer in this name, and you as the director of the company. I will come to meet with you so that we can both sit down and discuss further, what kind of business we will enter into or if need be expand your already existing business, but actually I hope to establish a five star hotel and go into real estate development as these are life time businesses that I know are of high yields interest any where in the world.

"Kindest attention, I am very sorry for the informalmanner in which this mail is reaching you. This isnecessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependableand trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seemstrange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgenceand pray that you take my request very serious.I amMr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12other Liberian Government officials was assassinatedas a result of a military coup that toppled thegovernment of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. Mayhis soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my familyhas always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.You can view our family web page below; (http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm)but please do not call me on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumedbugged by the government.I received information from a reliable source thatdescribed your country as being economically conducivefor investment and her people as transparent andtrustworthy to engaging business, which made me towrite you. As you may want to know and to make youless curious, I got your email address from anInternet site that portrayed you in good light. Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for theremoval ofPresident Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very goodexample of a bad leader. The President who neededsupport from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sumof twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensationfor my late father and solicited for my support. Iquickly made an arrangement with a courier companyhere in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an assetmanagement company in the uk. I did not supportPresident Charles Taylor because my conscience is notfor sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up inLiberia, he placed all the eligible members of myfamily under travel watch,confiscated all ourtraveling documents and frozen all our account inLiberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberiaand different peace keeping meetings were held andPresident Taylor was advised to step down for nationalpeace. On the 11th August 2003 President CharlesTaylor flied into exile but the problem we are havingnow is that he handed over power to his Vice-PresidentMoses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He wasthe person that instigated Taylor to confiscated allour traveling documents and frozen all our account inLiberia. That is why I requested for your sincereassistance pending when a fresh election will be heldhere. The main rebel faction Liberians United forReconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed tocontinue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. Therebels are not happy with the above development sothey still continued fighting. WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer theownership of the consignment /boxes containing thecash to you and issue you a power of attorney throughmy Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims tothe money as my proxy from the company in europe.The entire operation is risk free since it is only youand me and my Lawyer that knows the details of themoney after you must have taken the money to yourcountry where it is save my lawyer will then meet youin your country to use my share of the money forinvestment. Bearing in mind that your assistance isneeded to transfer this fund, I propose a commissionof 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you forthe expected services and assistance. Your private faxand telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedyconclusion of this transaction (our only hope in lifenow) urgently. Your urgent response via the aboveemail address is highly needed so as to stop furthercontact. I must use this opportunity to implore you toexercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matterextra ordinarily confidential whatever your decisionwhile I await your prompt response. Our phone lineboth home and abroad are bugged. So don�t call me. Iwill always call you at my convenient time and in aconducive atmosphere. PLS REPLY TO  chesson_joseph@yahoo.comRegards,J.Rodney Chesson. JR."

"sbwhoeopFriday March 5 2010 9:52 AMH: More trouble for Tories and Cameron. He needs to support NI peace not anotherproblem. SidMarch 5 2010New blow for Tories as lead slips in marginalsBy Nigel Morris and Michael SavagePoll shows crumbling support in target seats as DavidCameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom rowThe Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver generalelection victory for the party a poll last night disclosed.The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over thebillionaire peer Lord Ashcroft when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft hadmaintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years.The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that LordAshcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lordswithout paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune.With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month senior Tories have put a brave face on theirsliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year.They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has beenmasterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft.The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just twopoints over the past year.The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the electionexpected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent(up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election but 11 seats shortof an overall Commons majority.An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegroundsin most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats.The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by ashadow cabinet member as a ""mountain to climb"".The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commissionconcluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services controlled by Lord Ashcroftwere legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the oppositeconclusion.However the commission added its regret that the Tories refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft haddestroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company."
I agree.

"FYI early read out of Pakistan media reaction to strategic dialogue. Not bad overall at this point.Pakistan Media:Coverage of the final round of the U.S.-Pak Strategic Dialogue dominated the front pages of all newspapers andhourly bulletins of TV networks on Friday morning. Media highlighted reports that the U.S. and Pakistansought ""wide-ranging long term and substantive partnership"" and ""established a policy steering group forfurther talks on strategic issues."" The signing of a letter of intent between the U.S. and Pakistan to helpreconstruction of priority roads in Malakand division also received prominent display. Secretary of DefenseGates' meeting with his Pakistani counterpart and his comments that the ""U.S. wants to increase the militaryfunding of Pakistan"" received coverage. Pak Army Chief General Kayani's remarks that the ""military is willingto forgo its requests for hardware to ensure that Pakistan's energy and economic needs are met"" were alsoreported. Reports that GOP and the opposition are not on same page regarding talks with the U.S. receivedfront-page display. The civilian nuclear deal issue made news as ""The News"" reported that the ""FO seeks tohide unease over nuclear snub"" and ""The Nation"" reported on front-page that ""U.S. affirms durable partnershipbut no civilian N-deal.""

"FROM:MR NABA MOHAMMEDBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A D B)OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.Dear Sir/Madam,                        (PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL)I am NABA MOHAMMED the MANAGER in charge of BILL AND EXCHANGE section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A D B) Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso in West Africa.With due respect and egard I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on November  2001 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before my discovery to this development.Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was sum of $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3m)Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the Bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.Our Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""top secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your email.Yours faithfully,Mr NABA MOHAMMED HOME ADDRESS:288 QUEAZINFERDINAND AVENUE OUAGADOUGOUBURKINA-FASO._________________________________________________________________MSN Hotmail sur i-mode� : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre t�l�phone portable ! http://www.msn.fr/hotmailimode/"

"WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban with new financialsanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile withinsurgents.The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants' assets ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. Itfollows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus the topmilitary commander in Afghanistan and Sen. Carl Levin D-Mich. chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee forsanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan.Taken together the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. membercountries putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants.Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions including a key member of the Haqqani network whichdirectsoperations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctionedThursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leadsthe group with his father Jalaluddin.Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai the head of the Taliban's financial commission and Amir Abdullah theformer treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders asterrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations said Adam J. Szubin director ofTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financialnetworks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan"" he said.According to officials lshakzai is the head of the Taliban's financial commission has collected money for suicide attacksin Kandahar Afghanistan and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as amain financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled toKuwait Saudi Arabia Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings andcommunications with key leaders. Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group including from al-Qaida. Last week Gen. David Petraeus the top military commander in Afghanistan urged officials to add commandersfrom the Haqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time administration officials said a review was under way largelyaccelerated after the May 1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incidentPakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs then returned to theU.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas."

"My Name is Mr.Andre Koffi a credit officer with the oneof the leading Bank (Finance Trust House) here in Cotonou Republic Du Benin.In my department i discovered an abandoned sum of (USD 32 m)  in an accountthat belongs to one of our foreigncustomer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich,Germany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since i got information about his death, I have been expecting his next ofkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated inour banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all hissupposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crashleaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery thatI now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money toyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequentdisbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to gointo the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline herestipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Five years, the moneywill be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request offoreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by the fact that thecustomer was a foreigner and an Indigen cannot stand as next of kin to aforeigner.I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provisionof a foriegn account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during thebusiness,another 5% to help the less previlage and to assist the charityorganisations here in Africa and abroad while the rest 60% would be for meThereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to thepercentage indicated .Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,youmust apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceasedindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephoneand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in themoney will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by faxor email the text of the application .I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-freeand that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all requiredarrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trustingto hear from you immediately.Yours Faithfully,Mr.Andre Koffi"

I have contactedyou to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my clientbefore it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bankwhere this deposit valued at 45 million dollars is lodged.This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, orthe account will be confiscated because there is a governmentgazzette/mandate/authorising all banks to freeze or consificateany account that has not been servicable in a long period of time,this is geared towards capital flight for the economy.My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you asthe next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client, so that theproceeds of this account can be paid to you, then we can sharethe amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documentsto back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see thistransaction through. This will be executed under a legitimatearrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.If this business proposition offends your moral values, do accept myapology but if not, then contact me at once to indicate your interest,by giving me your telephone number, fax number and your address."

" Greetings,  I sincerely hope this message will meet you well. I am Joan Ahmed, the only Daughter of Eng. Kamal Ahmed,a construction Engineer and head of Balad Regional reconstruction project.He was assassinated last January in Balad, north of Baghdad by the Shiite militants following the political Sectarian uprising in Baghdad. I am writing from Europe, where I moved immediately after his death due to the violence and uncertainties back home as a result of the war and the purpose of my mail is to request for your assistance in a financial transaction. Before the death of my father, he deposited the sum of (US$12.5M)in a private Security Deposit Firm in Europe and this money was initially meant for the purchase of new construction machines.  I am seeking your assistance in transferring this money into a private or company account for investment purposes. I want to assure you that this fund is safe for investment. If you can be of assistance in this regard, kindly get back to me so we can discuss further.  Thanking you in anticipation of your cooperation. Best Regards, Joan Ahmed"

I can set this up thru ops if u want to call.The Secretary's Call Sheet forIraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar ZebariPurpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack onthe Iraqi Foreign Ministry.MI want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of ForeignAffairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of ForeignAffairs.al I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meetingthere and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.DI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need fordedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry to remain committed to the new Iraq.1:11 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.Background: On Wednesday August 19 what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdadresulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exactnumbers have not been confirmed media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad withover 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA where a VBIED wasexploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40injuries resulting from this attack with 70% of the building damaged. In April you were the first senior U.S. official tohold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi who attended your meeting at the MFA and who'swife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He mayhave lost a number of staff members. At this point we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed orwounded in the attack.

"Holbrooke's Contributions on Af/PakHolbrooke has assembled an unprecedented interagency team to carry out the work onAf/Pak — a whole-of-government team in DC and a reorganized and reenergized U.S.mission in Kabul.Holbrooke's team is actually getting things done including the implementation of morethan 20 detailed action plans. Some examples of the work thus far:• The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year.• Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically both through theconsolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) ofassistance contracts.•• Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels.• The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of theSwat refugee crisis.•• The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-borderissues.)11• Holbrooke's international diplomacy — in the Gulf with China with the cadre of otherspecial representatives — has translated into funding and equipment commitments morebuy-in and more patience.Holbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan andPakistan. Here are some examples:IllDefining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits)• The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidelreport; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke inventionAfghanistanThe clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced ""Afghanization"" -primarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF — as the preferablealternative to adding more troops.• The Reidel report calls for training 134000 army and 82000 police over two years;Holbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers andspeed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstaclesparticularly with respect to the police.Framing and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections:•Developing a strategy — in partnership with the Afghan government and others — for pursuingreconciliation/reintegration.• The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan government's efforts to reintegrate""non ideologically-committed"" insurgents who lay down their arms renounce al Qaedaand accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of thereport and is now working through the next phases.Prioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction• The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts — and the attendantneed to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods.Emphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies China and Turkey• The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. Itdoes not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries.• [NOTE:• This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report.Pakistan• The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue.Responding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Buner• Obviously the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to therefugee crisis was Holbrooke's team at its finest.Making the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priority• The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrooke'srecent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategiccommunications plan for Pakistan.

"I crave your indulgence for the unsolicited nature of this letter, butit was borne out of desperation and current development. Please bearwith me. I am Barrister Sanni Ado., a solicitor at law. I was the Personal attorney to (Mr.Peter Adams) a national of yourcountry, who owned an oil servicing company in Nigeria. Herein after shallbe referred to as my client. On the 21st of January, 2002,my client, hiswife and their three Children were involved in a car accident alongEko express road.All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. I know that my client had no living kin but i went ahead and made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this has proved unsuccessful. I only didso to be double sure of this act. After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to track a trust worthy person abroad over the Internet,hence I contacted you.I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and propertyleft behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Security Company where this huge deposits were lodged, particularly the Impex Security Company,where the deceased had an account valued at about USD$16million dollars has issued me a notice that in the event that no next of kin comes up for the claim,the accountwill be confiscated in three months time from now if not claimed .Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3yearsnow, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valuedat USD$16million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% shall be for me and 30% for you while 10% is earmarked for expensesthat will be incurred  during the process of Transfer of the fund. I have Every necessary Prove and legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimatearrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law."
We need details from our Embassy about this deal. The Russians often overpromise. But regardless if just proves againwhy we needed to go.
"Dear :sirI am Mr.JACOB UDERIKE, an accountant of the standard trustbank Plc,Lagos Branch.I have urgent and veryconfidential business proposal for you. I got yourcontact from the world trade center (W.T.C.)regionaloffice in Lagos,Nigeria although the details of myintention was not made known to them.On June 6 1999, An American oil consultant/contractorwith the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Mr.Trevor made a numbered time (fixed) deposited fortwelve calendar valued atUS$18,000,000.00(eighteenMillion Dorllars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I senta routine notification to his forwarding address butgot no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder andfinally I discovered from his contact employersNigerian National Petroleum corporation that Mr.Trevordied from an automobile accident. On furtherinvestigation, I found out that he did not leave aWILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin werefruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discoveredthat Mr.Trevor did not declare any next of kin in allhis official documents,including his Bank Depositpaperwork. This sum of US$18,000,000.00 is stillsitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolledover with the principal sum at the end of each year.Noone will come forward to claim it.According to theNigerian Law, at the expiration of 6(six) years, themoney will revert to the ownership of the NigerianGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Trevorso that the fruits of this old mans labor will not getinto the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple;1. I will like you to provide me immediately with yourfull names and address so that the attorney willprepare the necessary documents and affidavits, whichwill put you in place as the next of kin.2,your privet telephone and fax number for rasycommunication The money will be paid into your accountfor us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% foryou and 10% for the expencis that we are going to makeboth local and international during this processofthis transacation.There is no risk at all the paperwork for thistransaction will be done by the attorney and myposition as the Branch accountant guarantees thesuccessful execution of this transaction. If youare interested, please reply immediately via theprivate email address below.(jacobuderike@yahoo.com)Upon your response, Ishall then provide you with more details and relevantdocuments that will help you understand.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and restassured that this transaction would be most profitablefor both of us because I shall require your assistanceto invest my share in your country.Thanks and regards.Mr.JACOB UDERIKE"

"Permit me to first of all introduce myself. My name is Kenneth.c. Ndlovu, the eldest child of Mr Tarcisious Ndlovu from Zimbabwe.         During the current crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters> of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members > and their followers.My father was one of the best farmers in the country and> knowing that he did not support the president's> political ideology, the president's supporters invaded my father's farm burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments.        After the death of my father, my mother and I with my younger sister decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives. Before we moved, we were able to, with the assistance of a diplomat friend of my late father send the money> my father kept in the safe in my mother's house, which amounted to the sum of US$24.7 Million United States Dollars to Overseas. The diplomat, my father?s friend assited us in sending the money via Diplomatic courier. The funds are presently being kept away in the secret vaults of a private security firm based in overseas The officials of the firm are also not aware of the contents of the package and are of the belief that they are helping me in keeping my personal Valuables, because> of the way I packaged the consignment as family valuables. Myself and my mother then decided to contact any reliable overseas Partner who could assist us to collect and transfer this money out of the Security company to a safe account nominated by such a person, because we as asylum seekers here  in South Africa we are handicapped in doing this because our status here does not permit us to a lot of facilities. If my proposition is considered, for assisting us in this transaction, we intend to share funds in the ratio of 75% for me and my family, 20% for you then 5% will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction. There is no risk at all, as all the documents for the success of this transaction I will forward to you. If you are interested, please reply immediately to this.kenc1962@mail.nu  Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant  documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality,  and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  You can also visit the sites below to give you an insight of the injustice done to white farmers in my country. http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2787057.stm http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2571697.stm Awaiting your urgent reply Thanks and regards Kenneth .c.

In Buenos Aires andMontevideo I will speaking at two business conferences being hosted by Council of the Americas and in Chile I will bevisiting some of the public diplomacy programs we launched after the earthquake.You may recall that I have a long-standing relationship with Christina Kirchner going back to my Discovery days. We hadquite a large and successful business there. We are trying to arrange for me to meet with her when I am in BAand Arturo has briefed me on points he would like me to make if I get to spend some time with her.I thought yesterday went well although I think it is going to be hard going to keep the world interested and committedto raising the necessary funding.im
No -- I will add.
"The President/CEODear Sir/Madam,It is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request which I believe will come to you as a surprise since both of us are complete strangers.I am MR. AHMED, ABACHA the son of the late General SANNI ABACHA former president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.In brief details, after the death of my father the government of Nigeria arrested my elder brother and kept him in jail being the heir apparent of my late father until he was made to sign an authorization empowering the government to frozen all of my father�s account and seized his landed assets alleging that my late father looted the federal treasury during his tenure in office thereby leaving the family with visually no source of livelihood except for the goodwill we receive from family friends who appreciated the good and kindness done by our heroic father while in office as president.As if this inhuman act of the government was not enough, they frozen the account of my mother and restricted her movement even within the country. The family being faced with financial difficulties and having exhausted all avenues to make the present government return some of the money and landed assets confiscated from us, we launched a vigorous manhunt for any investment my late father could have maintained overseas directly or indirectly. In our relentless effort, last month we stumbled into a vital document kept in a little safe hidden in the basement of our house revealing that he maintained a private vault box deposit with a private finance and security firm in the Republic of South Africa. According to this document he has the sum of US$125,450,000.00 (One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) in his vault box deposit which the security firm is not aware off.Therefore, in our bid to recover this investment, my mother request that I immediately travel to South Africa to hold discussions with the management of the security company to discuss possible ways the family can take possession of the investment deposit being held with them. It was on this premise I was told by the management of the company that the agreement entered into with our late father is that his safe box deposit will be collected upon his instruction by his friend in the United States. This we strongly believe he did for security reasons as the then president. The management had therefore insisted that for them to release the vault box deposit, my family must appoint someone who can stand in for my late father on behalf of the family.In view of the above, my mother have asked me to stay behind in South Africa to source for someone from the United States who is willing to assist our family which is in die need at this point in time.However, please note that this transaction is guaranteed, safe and secured.Please do not hesitate to contact me at once should you be interested to help my family. Also, my family has decided to part with 25% of the total sum for your kind cooperation and assistance. My contact me with E-mail,Best regards,Ahmed, Abacha"
I will call all--around 7:10.

"http://www.bloomberq.comews/2010-07-14/americans-disappoving-of-obama-policies-poised-to-enable-republican-dains.htmlAmericans Disapproving Obama Poised to EnableRepublican GainsBy John McCormick and Catherine Dodge - Jul 14 2010•• Email• Share• PrintChart: Poll ResultsAttachment: Poll results and methodologyAmericans disapprove of U.S. President Barack Obama's handling of almost every major issue and aredeeply pessimistic about the nation's direction offering a bullish environment for Republicans in theNovember congressional elections.A majority or plurality disapproves of Obama's management of the economy health care the budgetdeficit the overhaul of financial market regulations and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico according to aBloomberg National Poll conducted July 9- 12. In addition almost 6 in 10 respondents say the war inAfghanistan is a lost cause.Almost two-thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction an even more sourassessment than in March when 58 percent felt that way. Two-thirds of independent voters arepessimistic while just 56 percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence.""They don't see any solutions in sight"" said J. Ann Selzer president of Selzer & Co. a Des Moines Iowa-based firm that conducted the nationwide survey. ""They have been hammered by the economy and thereis a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington. They seem to have lost hope.""Poll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and Republicanswith both sides getting 43 percent support. Among those who say they are most likely to voteRepublicans are favored 48 percent to 40 percent. The Republican advantage is even greater amonglikely voters who view the election as exceptionally important with Republicans beating Democrats 56percent to 34 percent.Control of CongressFor the Democrats whd control Congress and the White House the survey shows the potential 'for lossesin November when voters will fill all 435 House seats 36 Senate seats and 37 governorships. Theoutcome could affect °Pam's ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading upto his own 2012 re-election bid.The fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next fourmonths and whether unemployment drops much from its current 9.5 percent. A rising stock market couldhelp as well. So far this year the S&P 500 stock index has declined 1.8 percent.The public's disenchantment with the president's Policies doesn't extend to voter feelings about Obamahimself as he gets a job approval rating of 52 percent and personally is viewed favorably by 55 percent.Obama 48 remains more popular than any of the Republican figures tested in the poll and is topped onlyby Secretary of State :-- ;:!aity ant.cn and General Datd Petraeos the new commander of U.S. forces inAfghanistan among a list of 15 people and political parties reviewed.Republican LeadersThe only bright spot for Republican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob%) 1i:tele! who gets a 32percent favorable rating and an 18 percent unfavorable grade. Better-known party leaders such as formervice presidential candidate :a-et..n and former House Speaker Netfri: CirigPait both have negativeratings that outweigh the positive views.Although turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races the electorate isinterested. Four- fifths of Americans who plan to vote say November's election is very or exceptionallyimportant.The likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters Republicans and those with the highest incomes.Among those 55 and older. three-quarters say they will definitely vote compared with 48 percent of thoseyounger than 35. Four-fifths of Republicans say they will definitely vote compared with 65 percent ofDemocrats and 62 percent of independents.Referendum on °barnaSeeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters Republicans want to make the election anational referendum on Obama and the party in power while the White House and Democrats argue it isabout going forward rather than backward to failed policies.The challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future into more positive feelingsabout the economy among voters. In the poll Republicans have the advantage among the independentsoften critical to winning elections. Among independents likely to vote Republican congressionalcandidates are preferred to Democrats 50 percent to 29 percent.""Anything that has been tried hasn't resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary peoplelive"" Selzer said. ""That's a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party.""Incumbent DisadvantageA third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served inCongress for many years. About one-fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending amessage while three-quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas.""I don't know what these people are thinking in Washington"" says poll respondent Jeff Lockman 41 aprofessional golfer and Republican from Malvern Pennsylvania. ""They are going in 10 different directionsand they really don't know what to focus on.""The proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin't in1994 when Republicans took control of Congress and 2006 when Democrats took over.The public also has soured on Obama's foreign-policy priority the war in Afghanistan. While the presidenthas ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U.S. has a critical stake58 percent say it is a lost cause compared with 36 percent who say it can still be won. A slim majority ofRepublicans -- 52 percent -- say the U.S. can still win in Afghanistan while 71 percent of Democrats saythe conflict is lost.Afghanistan WithdrawalSix in 10 Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna's plan to start withdrawing forces in July2011 while one-third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there or even addingadditional forces.Reflecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won a third of Americans say they have becomeless supportive of the effort there in recent months.The Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with 1004 U.S. adults ages 18 or older. Percentagesbased on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.:4:?r;yr• '.3cwrra:1 who studies public opinion at the A;-necicar Entarpr:F.:e institute a public-policy researchgroup in Washington cails the poll ""very very grim news for the Democrats.""At the same time she says one silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans have yet to convincevoters that they have a plan.Obarna VisitOne signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just 26 percent of Americans say it would help aDemocratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama while 20 percent say it would hurt thecandidate and 54 percent say it wouldn't matter or they don't know.Obama's worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit where 59 percent disapprove and 37percent approve. It's his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken sinceSeptember 2009. The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than $1.5trillion or 10.6 percent of GDP according to projections the White House released in February. It was$1.4 trillion for the 2008-2009 fiscal year which covers the end ofGecrge W. Bush's presidency andObama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from hisRepublican predecessor's administration.""My biggest fear is we have people in government who don't have a clue about what is going on in theeconomy"" says poll respondent Jim Heeter 66 from Glendale Arizona. ""They have never run a businessor had to make a payroll.""Economy Health CareSlim majorities disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy and health care. When it comes tocreating jobs he gets 46 percent approval addressing problems on Wall Street 42 percent supportrunning the war in Afghanistan 46 percent approve and managing the BP Plc oil spill 46 percentsupport.Forty-five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for WallStreet. The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White House and Democrats on mostother issues.Almost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned toautomotive companies to help them stay in business while 37 percent have become less supportive ofthe health-care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year. A majority 61 percent say the nationshould wait and see how the health-care legislation works or leave it alone while 37 percent want to see itrepealed.Arizona Immigration LawAlmost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement todetain anyone who can't produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense as is contemplated inan Arizona law. Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans tosue Arizona.At least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to givefinancial assistance to the banking or automobile industries.Americans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate whovoted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost. A measure providingsuch support worth $34 billion is stalled in Congress.Clinton PopularityThe disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesn't carry over to all Democrats. Hillary Clinton 62 isviewed favorably by 61 percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans including 30 percent ofRepublicans and 21 percent of Democrats say the nation would be in a better place if she had beenelected president.The Tea Party movement which has been mainly associated with Republicans has lukewarm support inthe poll. A majority of 58 percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if acandidate was backed by Tea Party activists while a third of Republicans say that kind of backing wouldmake a candidate more appealing to them.Those who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement -- 44 percent ofall respondents -- include Democrats 65 percent and those with the highest incomes 52 percent.Independent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would bebetter served by reduced federal government compared with 39 percent overall."

"Dear Friend,Good day. I decided to contact you after I went through my father�s file. Hence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.My name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my country, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Our wicked President Robert  mugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and a moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.Here is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  deposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars (US$10,000,000.00) with a security company,The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal trunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company organization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.The government seized my father�s farms and bank account before his Murder. He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This is why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, so that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment of the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your assistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the government does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge sum of money. In view of this, The monetary policy/law does not allow such investment by an asylum seeker or refugee.

"    DEAR PARTNER.I am  Sabastian Gomez. an auditor and accountant with a bank here in Afic=aNigeria precisely.There is a fixed deposit of =A315,000,000.00 ( Fifteen Million Pounds Sta=rling)made to this bank since 1994 which is ten years now and sincethen no claim or withdrawal have been made on thisdeposit. Fortunately, I have been the person working onthe interest from the day of deposit to date. Theinteresting part of it is that the fixed depositbelongs to the late John Hughe a forigner, a civil engineer by profession=.thismeans that the account may have beenabandoned by the surviving family members or that theyare not even aware of the existence of the deposit. However, I just finished updating the interest of thedeposit this october, and it has come up to=A337,000,000.00 at the 3% interest rate per annum. Itis this interest that I am interested in because Iknow very well that the family will care less on whathappens to the interest if they  want to redeem thedeposit, they will be interested on the main money,that is if they are able to claim it at all because allthe money lodged into different banks here in Arica are now been claimedby the Nigerian government.Meanwhile, my plan is to withdraw just some amountfrom the accumulated interest and transfer it to a foreign account. which=will not evenaffect the main fixed deposit. I will give you thedetails of procedure and my full ID when I receiveyour reply and indication of partner. Your reward andamount to withdraw will be our mutual agreement toavoid any misunderstanding.We have noting to lose, we only courage to do this.

"Dear Prospective Partner, Accept my compliments. However strange or surprising this contact might seem =to you, I ask that you give due consideration to its importance, as we both =stand to benefit immensely. Though we have not met or know each other, this =is a criterion I have used to select you, as I wish to cut off all ties with =my people for security and safety reasons. I am a stepson and personal aide to the Late General Robert Guei of blessed =memory, former President of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). You may not be conversant with the present situation in my country, which has =gradually degenerated into a civil war. On September 19, 2002, My Dad led a =failed coup d'etat against President Laurent Gbagbo, in a bid to restore =political stability in my country. Unfortunately, he was killed. After my =Dad's death, there was confusion and power struggle in our camp; this led to =an insurgence of several factions and has left no hope for peace anytime =nearby.  To understand more on the situation click on this link =http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/17657.htm   I decided to flee my country, as I desired a peaceful life, and I no more =had interest in conflicts and wars.  To the point, the essence of my contact with you is to seek your most needed =assistance to siphon US$18,500,000 left in the bunker of my Dad=92s Private =Palace. Only my Dad and me knew about this fund. Now that my Dad is dead, I =intend to use this money for my personal benefit (as well as yours if you =accept to be my partner). I see justification in diverting the money, rather =using it to support the purchase of weapons for destruction of innocent lives =and properties.This money has been moved in cash in a trunk to my present location in Europe =through diplomatic means. I plan to invest this money in diversified =projects, and relocate to a private location. As you can understand, the kind =of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act =of desperation on my part, in order have my plans achieved in the shortest =possible time. When the trunk is claimed, we shall firstly have the money =deposited into an Offshore account in your name, as I am being discrete of =using my name for now. Then you shall have your own share withdrawn to an =account of your choice, and leave the rest as fixed deposit, for release to =me at the appropriate time for the investments and my relocation. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost =secrecy. Be informed that I am confiding in you by disclosing all this =information to you, hence it is only me (apparently you now) that have =knowledge of this. The importance of prosecuting this within the next few =days cannot be overlooked; hence your immediate response will be highly =appreciated.If you accept to assist me, for your reliable assistance, I will reward you =with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. On hearing from you, I shall disclose my location to you, and explain details =of your role in this. Furthermore, everything regarding this process will be =legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction =should be completed in a very short while, depending on your prompt response.=I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve =this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This =will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your =part.Sincerely,J.C.G.  --0105ea4d-0723-4297-aef8-f3f5e1ff0c78--"

"Hello My Dear, I got your contact through Internet searching and browsing and I want to establish a business relationship with you. I am Mr Momohh  Ngogbee, the Branch manager,National Bank of Dubai,UmmAl Quwain Branch,DUBAI,(UNITED ARAB EMIRATES),married with fourchildren. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation tocarry out this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999,an Oil consultant/contractor with Dubai PetroleumCorporation, MR DAVID AMEERALY, made a numbered time(fixed)deposit fortwelve calendar months,Valued at US$16,500, 000.00 (sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. upon maturity I sent a routine =notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from hiscontract employers,the Dubai Petroleum Corporation that MR DAVIDAMEERALY, died in the plane crash On October 31,1999,(an EgyptianBoeing767Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirmit yourself via the websitebelow:http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtmlOn further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILLand attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless . I therefore made further investigation and discovered that MR DAVIDAMEERALY,did not declare any next of kin or relations in all hisofficial documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$16,500, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward =to claim it and according to UNITED ARAB EMIRATES LAW,at the expiration =of(Ten) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the UNITED ARAB =EMIRATES Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to MRDAVID AMEERALY, so that the fruit of this old man labour will not getinto the hands of some corrupt Government officials.This is simple, Iwill like you to provide immediately your full name and address so thatI can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for preparing thenecessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as thenext of kin. Any bank account in any part of the world,which you will provide,willthen facilitate the transfer of this money to you as thebeneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of50% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.There is no risk at all. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and myposition as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution ofthis transaction.If you are interested,please reply immediately and upon your =responses,I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that =will help you understand the transaction.

"MY SECOND MAIL TO YOU.Dear Sir / Madam,I am Mr.Azzam Mahmud, Chairman of the Tender Committee in one of the leading oil company. My Committee is principally concerned with payment of all contract awarded from 2004 to date, in order of priority as regard capital projects of our corporation.I am positive and convince that you would provide us with solution to a money transfer deal valued at US$13 Million (Thirteen Million United States Dollars) and subsequently a joint business venture. I will need bank account in your country or offshore account.I would like to invest the money in manufacturing of products such as Household products, Electronic goods, Apparel and Textiles, Real Estate, Properties or Telecommunication in your country. If you have any other idea of investment, that would be welcomed by me. In the course of our duties as values, and project inspectors for the on-going liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, we have over-invoiced the value of some jobs done by foreign contractors to the tune of US$13Million."
Madam SecretaryThank you so much. It is very exciting to finally see the book in print (when I first got a copy I was almost afraid to lookinside it!). I hope you enjoy it. And yes I have been working with Lissa and others on the democracy/human rightsspeech.On the question about UK soldiers - the UK lost more soldiers in the Falklands than they have in Afghanistan:255 in the Falklands235 in Afghanistan (including British forces personnel and MOD civilians)Please let me know if you would like any other information on that.Again thank you so much and Happy Thanksgiving!SincerelyMike

Itwas as a result of these directives from governmentthat made the Board of Directors of our Bank to meet.

"We spoke to the Norway's Ambassador to the UN and they are joining the Alliance for Clean Cookstoves for $600000the first year. They noted that this is a down payment and would contribute a ""substantial amount for this endeavor"" inthe future. They wanted to move quickly for the CGI announcement and ant to see a business plan before they commitmore.Thnx for making this important call.

"<DIV><DIV><BR>With good faith i have come to you on this proposal<BR>which i feel you<BR>are liable of handling, and firstly i must introduce myself,i am PRINCE PHILIP<BR>GARBI, the first son and manager of Mr. Garbi<BR>Thembe, one of the most<BR>popular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was recently<BR>murdered in the land<BR>dispute in my country.<BR>I got your contact through network online hence<BR>decided to write you,<BR>Before the death of my father, he took me to<BR>Johannesburg to deposit the<BR>sum of US29 million ( twenty-nine million, <BR>United States<BR>dollars), in one of the private security company, as<BR>he foresaw the<BR>looming danger in Zimbabwe, this money was deposited<BR>in a box as family<BR>valuables to avoid much demurrage from security<BR>company. This amount was<BR>meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals<BR>for a new Farm<BR>establishment in Swaziland.<BR>This land problem came when Zimbabwean President<BR>Mr.Robert Mugabe<BR>introduced a new  Land Reform Act wholly affecting<BR>the rich white farmers<BR>and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the<BR>killing and mobbing<BR>by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the<BR>society. In fact a<BR>lot of people were killed because of this Land<BR>reform Act of which my<BR>father was one of the victims.<BR>It is against this background that, my family and I<BR>fled Zimbabwe for<BR>fear of our lives and are currently staying in the<BR>Netherlands where we<BR>are seeking political asylum and more so have<BR>decided to transfer my<BR>father's fund to a more reliable foreign account,<BR>Since the law of<BR>Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to<BR>open any bank account<BR>or to be involved in any financial transaction<BR>throughout the<BR>Territorial zone of Netherlands.<BR>As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with<BR>the responsibility of<BR>seeking a genuine foreign account where this money<BR>could be transferred<BR>without the knowledge of  my government who are bent<BR>on taking everything<BR>we have got. Since the South African government<BR>seems to be playing<BR>along with them, I am now faced with the dilemma of<BR>moving this fund out<BR>of South Africa for fear of going through the same<BR>experience in future<BR>because both countries have similar political<BR>history.<BR>As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I<BR>have to entrust my<BR>future and that of my family in his hands, I must<BR>let you know that this<BR>transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me<BR>and my family all I<BR>want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements<BR>with the security<BR>company to clear the consignment (funds) from their<BR>affiliate office<BR>here in the Netherlands as i have already given<BR>directives for the<BR>consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from<BR>South Africa. But<BR>before then all modalities will have to be put in<BR>place like change of<BR>ownership to the consignment and more importantly<BR>this money I intend to<BR>use for investment.<BR>I have two options for you.

"Hillary: This is the most provocative and significant analysis to come out of the recent election. Its author is a right-wingRepublican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events. I disagree with the ideological andpartisan undercurrent of the piece especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather thanthe administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is noreason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern ofthe past is that the deficit the talisman of Hoover Republicans moves only partisan Republicans and that Democratsascend if the economy is progressing its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universalimpact. That is not happening now. This analysis therefore may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VAdon't show up in the email but they are described. SidReturn to the ArticleNovember 13 2009Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama?By Sean TrendeJohn Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set inVirginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner who runs a moderate campaign that appeals toupper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters and manages to put together a winning coalition that ifimitated in other states might put the Democrats in power for decades to come.Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner'scoalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarilysuccessful one for Democrats breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996 and ultimately enabling the electionof the most liberal President in American History last year.Given this background it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come inVirginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (thoughnot the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins and theGOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assemblyraces by fewer than 1000 votes.There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election it's silly to argue that the GOP brand istoo damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weaknessamong Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining theirRepublican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor inelections.But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections they do provide snapshots ofthe mood of the electorate and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democraticcoalition building it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats.The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians:Culturally conservative hawkish and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They beganbreaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions blacks andliberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here.But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities liberalsurban voters and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South who still preferred amoderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used acombination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovationfor Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County NY Orange County CA and Fairfax County VA had fueled the rise of theRepublican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win byeight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal he probably would have won by more.Clinton intuited that suburban voters are generally speaking culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you callsomeone ""macaca"" and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal eitherand are fans of ""law and order."" They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth but like good schools and a cleanenvironment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives balancedbudgets are the ultimate ""good government"" indicator for these voters.Clinton delivered on all of these issues keeping tax increases fairly small and balancing the budget for much of his term.In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility economicgrowth moderate taxes and smart government. In other words he finally shed the ""Carter"" label for the Democrats. Thisin turn made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats -one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him.George W. Bush's presidency in turn was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agendaa fiscal trainwreck two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later these suburban voters trended even moreheavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008 Democrats held most of the suburban districts around major metropolitan areas and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have puttogether a massive 2008 Presidential majority combining minorities liberals Jacksonians Catholics and suburbanites.The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result.But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left thestage but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obamareceived 53% of the vote instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency.Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among theremaining portions of his base. In other words while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's it was deeper. Faced withvanishing 401ks and home values and disgust with Bush's presidency suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals wereenthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first blackPresident.But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once and governing a coalition of suburbanitespoor blacks and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of theparty gone if that enthusiasm dissipates or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out thedoor the party isn't left with much.We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001 and look atthe counties that Mark Warner won.The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some it blended together rural Democrats in themining counties in the west of the state college voters around Charlottesville and black voters combined with rural whitesin the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalitionbut it worked.Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008:The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That areabecomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis Mondaleand Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved induring the 1920s.As I said this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other thanObama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that theJacksonian divorce may in fact be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state and seemed — atleast on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen obviously. Let's look at how Virginiachanged from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week:The redder a county is the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved towardDemocrats.We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DCsuburbs in the northeast the Hampton Roads area in the southeast and Richmond just to the north and west of HamptonRoads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop theticket rural Virginia went solidly Republican.We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let'scompare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map we look at ""relative movement."" Becauseeverything in the state moved toward McDonnell a map just showing ""movement"" would be solid dark red and not ofmuch use. So instead if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell it is colored a shade of red if it movedless than 9 points toward McDonnell it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI].We see the same result. Just since 2005 rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven'tmoved much at all relative to the rest of the state while the more heavily African American counties in the southernportion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). Thissuggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama.Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again because the movement here was sodramatic statewide we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at ""relative"" shifts.The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008 but that's because they were already giving Republicansaround 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember ""blue"" in a relative map stillmeans slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come inthe DC exurbs in the 1-95 corridor and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area.In other words the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able towin without them but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words two pieces of theClinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away.This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party there isvery very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy tomake an understatement hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault but the $787 billion stimulus the trilliondollar healthcare bill the automobile bailout and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decademake suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for atsome point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt as they do most Presidents in their firstyear but they are becoming very very worried and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise toenact a net spending cut any more.Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate but when themood of the country is starting to swing against your party it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this outwhen he ran in a similar environment in 2005 and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the deathpenalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008 I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18points even holding everything else equal.The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats inthe House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia or came close to losing were suburban. The Philly suburbsvoted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote likeit did in 1984 but Chris Christie nearly carried it and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie ToddWhitman or Tom Kean he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. ConservativeRepublicans won elections in Westchester County New York and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on theoutskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figuresprominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executivethere with an obscure underfunded candidate. In other words in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seenhis attack ads on McDonell's thesis the Democrats still lost suburban voters.States with a Democratic base of liberals urbanites and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't movedmuch against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor andSenator in classic ""Emerging Democratic Majority"" states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And ofcourse in Jacksonian states like Kentucky he's below 40%.This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy Republican missteps and a host of otherfactors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the pollsto enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting toshow its downside for downticket Democrats.The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart Democrats could findthemselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s.Sean Trende can be reached at strende@realclearpolitics.com.Page Printed from:http://www.realclearpolitics.comiarticles/2009111/13/can_the_clinton_coalition_survivethe_age_of_obama_99046.html at November 13 2009 - 08:19:49 AM CST"

"Dear Blessed One,As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me,because, I believe everyone will die someday.My name is George Boka ,a merchant in South Africa and Zimbabwe.  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I neverreally cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was alwayshostile to people and only focused on my business as thatwas the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all thisas I now know that there is more to life than just wantingto have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to thisworld I would live my life a different way from how I havelived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed andgiven most of my property and assets to my immediate andextended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. Sofar, I have distributed money to some charity organizationsin the U.A.E, Algeria,Malaysia and some countries inAfrica. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, Icannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of myaccounts and distribute the money which I have there tocharity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refusedand kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trustthem anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what Ihave left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cashdeposit of One Million United States DollarsUS$1,000,000,00 that I have with a Security Companyabroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit anddispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 10% for you,your time and also anyexpenses incured during this Great task.God be with you.George Boka"

"Good Day,With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.My name is Mr.Mako Okere, the first son of Iko Okere,one of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons. However,I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my father forsaw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in major companies. We then went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This money was deposited with this Private Security company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana and Swaziland.President Mugabe's support for the violent imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe to South Africa where I was arrested and detained for eight(8 good month)in jail.I fled south Africa for The Netherlands with the help of the present prison command chief officer in Charge(P.C.C.O)I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, and they have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg here. I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial ransaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be transferred, ence this proposal to you.You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with the arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Afri! ca to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you representing me.For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply.I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the account here for me.Please, I want you to maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you inadvance as I anticipate your co-operation.Thanks and God bless.Sincerely,Mako Okere"

"Have you seen this story? I look forward to discussing.Gates Says U.S. Lacks Strategy to Curb Iran's Nuclear DriveBy DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKERPublished: April 18 2010WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top WhiteHouse officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Iran's steady progresstoward nuclear capability according to government officials familiar with the document.Several officials said the highly classified analysis written in January to President Obama's national security adviser Gen.James L. Jones touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon the White House and the intelligence agencies todevelop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives still under development to beconsidered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course.Officials familiar with the memo's contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy and notsections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies.One senior official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memodescribed the document as ""a wake-up call."" But White House officials dispute that view insisting that for 15 monthsthey had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Iran's nuclear program.In an interview on Friday General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: ""On Iran we are doingwhat we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to seedoesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.""But in his memo Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns including the absence of an effective strategy should Iranchoose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts itneeds for a nuclear weapon - fuel designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon.In that case Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a""virtual"" nuclear weapons state.According to several officials the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might containIran's power if it decided to produce a weapon and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could beobtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported which officials said they considered to be a less-likelypossibility.Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman Geoff Morrell declined comment on specifics in thedocument but issued a statement on Saturday saying ""The secretary believes the president and his national securityteam have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range ofcontingencies with respect to Iran.""Pressed on the administration's ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow.Iran's program to proceed a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there wasa line Iran would not be permitted to cross.The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not ""acquire a nuclear capability"" a step Tehrancould get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. ""That includes the ability to have a breakout"" he saidusing the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses itstechnology to build a small arsenal.Nearly two weeks ago Mr. Obama in an interview with The New York Times was asked about whether he saw adifference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. ""I'm not going to parse that rightnow"" he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors andas he said ""became a self-professed nuclear state.""Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final stepstoward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press"" he said: ""If their policy is to go tothe threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon how do you tell that they have not assembled? I don't actually knowhow you would verify that."" But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties and he said ""It's going slow -slower than they anticipated but they are moving in that direction.""Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy and he has been known over his career toissue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise.Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the UnitedStates was not adequately prepared.He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomaticengagement.Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped thatthe revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountainnear Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent inwhat proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for amedical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo those negotiations had collapsed.Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the WhiteHouse did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In factjust before Mr. Gates issued his warning the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen wrote an official""chairman's guidance"" to his staff saying that while any military option would have ""limited results"" against Iran'snuclear facilities preparations needed to be stepped up.""Should the president call for military options we must have them ready"" the admiral wrote.Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were underway. So did General Jones. ""The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to beprepared for every possible contingency"" he said in the interview.

"August 8 2010Gary SickAmerica and Iran: Strikes Sanctions and ScapegoatsFor the pundits there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israeland/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to changeits nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues the answers are an easy no and no.Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table thereby giving the pundits (and thecrowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pageswhere it has been for years. As a lede it sells columns and newspapers so it will not go away. But as analysis itis either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur it would have been at the end of the Bushadministration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted itunequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed judging from hissubsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush after looking the potentialconsequences resisted the advice of his neocon advisers his previously dominant vice president and thereported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that BarackObama with the same catastrophic scenario before him will approve? Forget it.Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their securityand survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraqin the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out ofIraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet although Iraq hadabandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people andhis enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that therewas no immediate necessity to come clean. They after all controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmenmanaged the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people a rotundTariq Aziz sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar informed a worried UN representative that it would begood for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions hadmade criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. Thebiggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around SaddamHussein.Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web offinancial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significantproblems for the leadership. Iran's critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because ofcheap energy prices inside the country artificially propped up by massive subsidies energy demand is soaring.This siphons off a lot of Iran's oil production which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hardcurrency.At the same time because Iran's oil fields are old and complex they require modern technology to maintainproduction. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oilcompanies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions ironically assisted byIran's own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outsideinvestors. As a result Iran's oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soakedup by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices this means that Iran's hard currencyearnings are drying up at an alarming rate.This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competenteconomic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene'i the Supreme Leaderseems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the RevolutionaryGuards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah's regimecould have imagined.President Ahmadinejad also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards is free to indulge his taste for outlandishand irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effectdrives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctionsagainst Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossadagent: no one he observed had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At thesame time under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.But to be fair Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the ""third rail"" ofIranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount ofsubsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation including torching filling stations.But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He is nowaddressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage including closingthe bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer including theInternational Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economicinterests by his belligerent rhetoric always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembleshis populist predecessors from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America andIsrael the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of hisown eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iranis capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. TheRevolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran's military its economy and its politics. Iranincreasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and '30s thatwe call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons from the millenarians on the far rightwho choose to believe that Khamene'i is the personal representative of God on earth to the pragmaticconservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership to the reformists of the Green movement whoseobjective is to put the ""republic"" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice.This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration willback the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied withdomestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it willinadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoatfor everything that goes wrong in Iran."

Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. <BR>On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch. <BR>Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. <BR>I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safekeeping. <BR>No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. <BR>Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. <BR>I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. <BR>The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. <BR>If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. <BR>Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) <BR>Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication. <BR>Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com ) <BR>Thanks and regards. <BR>TONY SMITH <BR><BR>N.B <BR>Reply me only on this my alternative email <BR>ttss7520062006@mixmail.com <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BODY>"

"Greetings and Compliments.I have gotten your contact from the internet, listed as a professional whom I might be able to transact with, and this makes me feel I may make a sincere proposition to you, and I have decided to make this preposition to you in good faith, which relates to a realistic and genuinely simplistic business opening that needs the participation of a person with your expertise, and ingenuity and a clear indication totrustworthiness and sincerity.I am a lawyer residing and practicing in Nigeria as you may need to know and I represent the interest of a client who is a Brother as well who has made an offer to me which is most lucrative, my correspondence with you from hence is dictated by the need for us to get the participation of a neutral foreigner who will assist us perfect the transaction.My client was a prominent figure in the Military Politics and rule of my country for about ten years and he has had complicity in a few economic scandals and a host of litigations too he has had a lot of his physical and monetary assets seized by the Nigerian Government who consider him as a part of the corrupt machinery of the then Military Government. Now he has a substantial amount deposited in a bank in Nigeria (US$ 25.M.) and he is very scared that this account will be discovered because similar accounts in Switzerland and England were previously discovered and frozen by the governments of those countries in collaboration with the Government of Nigeria.Precisely, my client's family returned US$ 1B. to the government of Nigeria in 2002 under the direction of the Swiss banking authorities, this is a confirmable matter, even as the existence of the fund mentioned above is confirmable. Now it is his intention to migrate with his family out of Nigeria towards the Middle East and he depends so much on this fund, thus he islooking for a reliable and trustworthy person who will receive the moneydiscreetly and then transfer the money at a latter date to a neutral account to be established in Lebanon when he finally succeeds with his emigration plan.If you accept my proposition and agree to participate in this transaction, you will in no case whatsoever undertake risk- expend money or execute any unreasonable task- whereas you will be well remunerated, in principle you will receive 10% of the amount transferred to you once the transaction is completed.Apart from this there is another sum of Money, held up in a Security Company (In Cash), the Money was earmarked for the support of the cause of Charity in India, but it was never retrieved before the demise of my clients father, now my client also wants to retrieve this money in addition to the money with the bank in Nigeria.

I am the first and only son of BRIGADIER VUSI  JONES. I  am presently resident in South Africa.I got your contact address from a business directory  in JohannesburgChamber of commerce and Industry. On  behalf of my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETHVUSI I  desided to solicit for your assistance to transfer  the sum of US$21.5MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)inheritedfrom my late father, into your personal company's account.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in  charge of Arms andAmmunation procurement for the Angola  Army. In his WILL, he specificallydrew my attention  to the said sum of money which he deposited in a  safe box ofa private Security Company in Johannesburg-  South Africa in a treasure box,fully documented in  my name.IN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE  MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOURATTENTION TO US$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITYCOMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATEDAND OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITHGOVERNMENT FUNDS AND  PROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUETO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNEDBY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THISAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUMOF US$21.5 MILLION. IN  CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATHONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENT  PURPOSES.>From the above, you will understand that the lives  and future of my familydepens on this money, as such I  will be grateful if you can assist us. We are nowliving in South Africa as political Asylum seekers and financial laws andregulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to suchhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hencei am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set asidefor local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once wehave established  trust and confidence between ourselves.

"Gooday Sir/Madam,I am Luis Tasharofi  Jnr. I am a collage student of London School ofEconomics, U.K. I am compelled to contact you concerning a businessdeal,which I believe will be beneficial to you and I.  My father, HisExcellency, Ambassador Krikor Tasharofi was a diplomat. In his lifetime, he was an Ambassador emeritus. While in office, he was highly connected because of his expertise in transferring money to coded accounts for important Clients at short notices and without detection. Due to his  connections in high places, at the end of his tenure as an Ambassador, he became acquainted with important African leaders, politicians etc who  patronized him to help them transfer money out of Africa and this he did with relative ease.I was quite close to him and was privy to his business deals because heused to confide in me. I was also aware of his numerous trips to Europeand theAmericas to make large cash deposits in several Banks. Recently, my father came to England en route Liechtenstein to make large cash deposits for one of his clients. We met on July 6th, 2005 at his hotel room and on July 7th, 2005, I learnt that he was one of the victims of the London Terror attack.After the recovery of his body, I and my other  siblings were makingarrangements for his burial when on July 27th, 2005,one of theEmbassy�s staff contacted me and informed me that my late father  took him into confidence and told him of some boxes kept at the Embassy�s storage house. The Staff also informed me that now that my father was dead,  he had no option than to hand the boxes over to me.Upon collecting the boxes, I opened it and to my surprise, it containslarge sum of money to the Value of US$84 Million US Dollars. I quicklyclose theboxes and left it there as the embassy storage house did not know what is  the content in the boxes. My problem now is how to move this money out ofthe U.K. into a designated Bank account. I have tried to use my late  father�s old routes to transfer it but met a brick wall and that is why Ihave decided to seek for external assistance in the matter.I can assure you that this business is 100% risk free, as my latefather�s Clients who owns the money would never suspect that I am involved. For your assistance I will offer you 20% of the total sum, for your assistance so please get back to me as soon as possible to enable me give you the details on how we are going to proceed."

"http://www.rte.ieews/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html I got yourcontact through a search on the internethere in South Africa. I do not know your person but Iam relying on faith to see me through. During the warwaged against the farmers in Zimbabwe by thesupporters and cohorts of President Robert Mugabe toclaim all the white owned farms in our country, mylate husband belonged to one of the classes of farmersalso targeted by the ZANU-PF armed group,because hedid not support theirideas and policies of takingwhite farmers land by force. Blackwar veterans claiming tobe farmers, invaded myhusband's house on April 17, 2000 at about 8.35pm inMacheke/Virginia district and murdered him because ofhis insistence that white farmers be allowed to retaintheir farmlands despite the  recently introduced landreforms""Act"" in Zimbabwe by the head of state,President Robert Mugabe. Until his death he was one of the prominent members ofthe Zimbabwean Farmers'Union (ZFU)But before myhusbands death, he first escaped safely intoneighbouring South Africa with his life time fortuneof US$37m(Thirty-seven Million USdollars)cash, important documents of property titleand other valuables which were concealed and secured in a trunkbox, and transported to Johannesburg through diplomatic means. The consignment box is currently safely lodged andsecured in the vaults of a private security firm herein Johannesburg after which he returned to zimbabwewhile he was killed. The fund was meant for thepurchase of new tractors,machinery and agro-alliedchemicals for our new farms acquired in Swaziland. This land problem came when President  Robert Mugabeintroduced a new land act""ModusOperandi"" reform whichwholly affected the rich white farmers. A lot ofpeople were killed because of this land reforms ""Act""of which my late husband was one of the maintargets.Based on this,I had to flee the country withmy two children and my only late husband personalassistance [PA] Mr Chris Mutembi who was his personalassistant{PA}. We are now in south africa as political assylumseekers/refugees. We decided to contact you to assist us in removingthis money my husband kept in a private securitycompany here in south africa to your account or anypart of the world for investments as themonetary/investment laws here in south africaprohibits refugees and illegal immigrants fromoperating bank accounts or be involved in anytransaction/investment. Based on this, we are contacting you hoping that you will assist uswith this transaction. As a widow, I am saddled with the responsibility ofseeking a genuine and an honest person who will assistus in investing this money in a highly profit yeildingventures without the knowledge of mycountry(Zimbabwe)government who are bent on takingeverything my late husband had after confiscating all his farmlands andinvestments in Zimbabwe .

"Apparently you can't get away from me. We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here'smy piece....Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America'sallies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one heinherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.In fact the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one and it is designed tocounter an evolving Iranian threat not to mollify Russian anxieties.Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar inthe Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rocketsthat could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter-range Iranian missiles and it would have left much of Europe notably including America'sally Turkey unprotected.Over the last several years the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a fewlong-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose animmediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East as well as to US forcesstationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defencecapability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-rangeIranian missiles in the future.The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarmshould recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credibleone strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts theresuspected that the US rockets in Poland while advertised as defensive could be usedoffensively even pre-emptively against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenariowas not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision nor should it have been. Howeverby removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations the president hasimproved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway inGeneva.Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic -that is intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easygiven the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington) the US and Russia will be on trackfor further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedevwho are due to meet in New York this week have jointly called for the eventual goal ofeliminating nuclear weapons.As they and their successors take steps in that direction they will have to grapple with astark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side beingvulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump theother side's offence the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will beon hair-trigger making war more likely in a crisis.American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initiallysceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensivecapability of both superpowers the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to aseries of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons wereexpected to with us forever the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence Ronald Reaganwas not. The late US president championed the development of a space-basedcomprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutualdeterrence — ""impotent and obsolete.""Many experts believed Reagan's vision which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars wasan impossible dream. So did his successor George H. W. Bush who treated the programwith benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms ReductionTalks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened theSTART process pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a nationalmissile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites inPoland and the Czech Republic was as one of his aides told me at the time in largemeasure about ""pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.""Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself who studiedarms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences andregulation of defences. However they have avoided raising that issue in the context of lastweek's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its ownmerits vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fightswith the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate theprinciples of the ABM treaty.Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulatingstrategic defences. Otherwise continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will beeither impossible or worse dangerous.The author is president of the Brookings Institution."

It has defiled all forms ofmedicine, and right now I have only about a few monthsto live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as Inever really cared for anyone not even myself but mybusiness.

"Dear Sir, I am Mr. Philip jones, an official with one of the APEX banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our share . Awaiting your urgent reply, Mr.Philip Jones. "

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A d=ollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one= of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (July 21,= 2003) in a plane crash.

"        charset=""iso-8859-1""Dear friend, I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Kenneth Masuku, the first and only surviving son of late Marc Masuku one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father, he had given me the certificate of deposite he used to deposit the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five Hundred United State Dollars) in one of the private security companies in Europe, as family valuables, when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe's war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum. I have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family's survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets. There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 15% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you. I await your reply through the above media, while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction. I shall furnish you with more details on request. Yours truly, Kenneth Masuku "
"sbwhoeopThursday October 22 2009 12:02 AMHfyi: Hague report and DeMint... SidH: Here's the Guardian account of Hague's post-meeting press briefing. And below that the article on DeMint. SWilliam Hague addresses US fears over Tories'EU allies•Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations are a smear'•Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader• Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt• quardian.co.uk Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BSTWilliam Hague the shadow foreign secretary yesterday defended the Conservatives' alliance with far-right parties inEurope during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state Hillary Clinton.Hague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives' partners some of whose members have taken part incommemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom inPoland.The shadow foreign secretary who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton told her the accusations were part of asmear campaign by the Guardian and others.The row has overshadowed Hague's visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for takingpower.Speaking to the media afterwards Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski of Poland's Law and Justice party wasnot consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance Haguesaid: ""This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous.""Jewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.The state department was careful not be drawn into the issue not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics orissues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: ""I can say that the two had a good wide-rangingdiscussion on a broad range of issues but can't get into details or substance of that discussion.""Hague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play alesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.Hague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran theBalkans the Middle East Northern Ireland Afghanistan and climate change.""No one has raised with me all day the other issue of the parties in our grouping but I raised that with secretary of stateClinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those"" Hague said.""I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as asmear campaign against some of its members.""He noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism inEurope and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. ""These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic""Hague said.As for the Latvians of the six governing parties ""five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration thathave been criticised."" Some were members of the Conservatives' previous alliance the European People's party.On Conservative Euroscepticism Hague said: ""I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important todistinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be finda Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. ""Later he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blairwould be appointed ""over my dead body"".http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-10/irm-contras-scary-sequelIran-Contra's Scary Sequelby Art LevineThe Daily BeastOctober 10 2009 I 6:55pmRepublicans have opened a new front against Obama a southern front south of the border—Latin America.The clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in theGeorge W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of SouthCarolina.A freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America DeMintis best known for boasting that health care would be the ""Waterloo"" that will ""break"" Obama. He recentlyprovoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to ""assess"" the crisis.The Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president Manuel Zelaya a leftist whowas expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his ""intransigence""in putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America and initially deniedmoney for DeMint's trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through theDefense Department.""DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order todefend a coup"" says Adam Isacson a Latin American specialist at Washington's Center for InternationalPolicy.""Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet and paralyzed policy byprovoking the [DeMint] holds"" Julia Sweig the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on ForeignRelations told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: ""These losers from the Bush administration who droveLatin American policy off a frickin' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy"" one aide told The Daily Beast.A number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin Americanpolicy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stanceagainst the president installed by the Honduran military Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire toappease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration ""slow-walked"" itsresponse to the coup this summer Sweig says.More recently though the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least$35 million and blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter intoserious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.Informed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washingtonand helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance.An informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelayalegal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich a Cuban-American who headed theState Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal and wassubsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General whichfound he engaged in ""prohibited covert activities"" by using public funds to attack Reagan's critics. Reich whowas later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs andis now a private consultant launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.""Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I'm an architect of the Zelayacoup"" he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as ""crap""asserting they were only based on a fired House staffer's unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin a LatinAmerican history professor at NYU has a darker view of Reich's role: ""It's kind of the origins of SwiftBoating"" he says. ""It's all related to what he's doing now.""Conservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against theworldwide condemnation of the coup. ""It's not the first time all the countries in the world have been wrong""Reich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies takingThe New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby onbehalf of the Micheletti regime. ""I guess my facts interfered with [the] story"" he says. ""Can you believe someof my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?"" ADeMint spokesman says the senator hasn't even met with Reich to talk about Honduras although a Reich aidesays they've spoken to DeMint's staff.Adding to the mystery of the coup left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservativessay are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya's regime. Hehas firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: ""I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy chargesagainst me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya."" But the rumors may add to his auraof power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He's drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations bypenning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined ""I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras.""Perhaps the primary influence on DeMint's thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyerMiguel Estrada whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by theSenate. In addition to Reich other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles ininfluencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega a former aideto the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as anassistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2 Noriega appeared on TheNewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a formerambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute—not as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.Noriega officially registered his firm Visions America as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-July. Yet the Times reported he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetingsbetween supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit toWashington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10 Foreign Policy reportedoccurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich—along with a former Honduransupreme court justice and Lanny Davis a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testifiedin favor of the current regime. Noriega's office declined to return phone calls about his work.The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama'spicks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon current assistant secretary for Western HemisphereAffairs has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela director of GeorgetownUniversity's Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the NationalSecurity Council during President Clinton's second term has been tapped to be assistant secretary for WesternHemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committeein late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes ""They're not polarizing figures.""But for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the July 8 nomination hearings Valenzuela angered DeMintby defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: ""In my studies of militarycoups in Latin America this was a classic military coup"" Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he hascontinually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holdsincluding the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.DeMint's spokesperson Wesley Denton says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about animportant crisis. ""If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats then why hasn't Senator Reid broughtthem to the floor?"" he asks. ""There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote onthem."" Technically that's true but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has takenup the issue of Honduras Denton claims because ""the State Department's actions were directly relevant to twonominees seeking the committee's approval.""Yet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to ""break""Obama—one congressional observer jokes ""He couldn't find Honduras on a map.""Art Levine a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly has written for Mother Jones The AmericanProspect The New Republic The Atlantic Slate.com Salon. corn and numerous other publications.

As representative with contacts in the Middle East/Africa,upon the tsunami disaster in his home country of Indonesia, in which he was on a private visit to see his sick old parents, i have made personal contacts to his resident here in London and through some foreign mission in Indonesia, and has discovered that he and his entire family perished in the said natural disaster in his local community in Indonesia. On further investigation, it also discovered that he died without making a WILL (En-testate) and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, it was discovered in the Late Mr. JOSHUA WANG bank papers that the only persons stated as his entitled next of kin is his only wife, who also died with him in the disaster,so presently their is no persons to declare as the next of kin to the said fund and as it stand now , No person will ever come forward to claim it. As the bank papers/documents have only his late wife name, since they have no child before their sudden death. In accordance with the Banking Federal Laws and constitution, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies as the next of Kin to claim the funds within certain period.Consequently, I shall present you as a foreign partner to stand in as the next of kin to late Mr.JOSHUA WANG so that you and I can benefit from the fruits of this old man's labor and also donate certain portion of the fund to all victims of the Tsunami disasters through humanitarian Organization.

"FROM THE DESK OF IBRAHIM MUSSA,BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB)OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICA.With Due RespectI am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of african development bank (ADB). I crave your indulgence as i contact you in such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter carefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial rewards for both of us.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred Thousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 in a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the plan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as ""unclaimed fund"". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply,I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully,ibrahim mussa,Bill and exchange manager,African Development bank ADB_________________________________________________________________D�couvrez Live.com : le nouveau moteur de recherche par Messenger! http://www.windowslive.fr/livecom/"

Helpful editorial in wp. We'll try and get pickup in international media.Jm
"H: Assume you have seen the ""Petraeus briefing story"" or otherwise are familiar with its contents. In any case here it is. Itwas blazoned atop the Foreign Policy website the most widely read site on international affairs daily owned andpublished by the Washington Post. Below the piece is a note by its writer about his sourcing that appeared on a smallwebsite elsewhere. Also I've included an article by Max Blumenthal who spends his time on this issue and plans to moveto Israel for about 6-8 months to write a book. He tracks a lot of things that do not appear in the mainstream press. Sidhttp://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_storyThe Petraeus briefing: Biden's embarrassmentis not the whole storyPosted By Mark Perry 4Saturday March 13 2010 -On Jan. 16 two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East) arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs ofStaff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOMcommander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-slide 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception amongArab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel that CENTCOM's mostly Arab constituency was losingfaith in American promises that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing inthe region and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) ""too old too slow ... andtoo late.""The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself onwhat is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followedfrom a December 2009 tour of the region where on Petraeus's instructions they spoke to senior Arab leaders.""Everywhere they went the message was pretty humbling"" a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. ""Americawas not only viewed as weak but its military posture in the region was eroding."" But Petraeus wasn't finished: two daysafter the Mullen briefing Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which withIsrael is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM) be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus's reasonwas straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arableaders as engaged in the region's most troublesome conflict.[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House.""CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue and CENTCOM didpropose a UCP change but to CJCS not to the WH"" the officer said via email. ""GEN Petraeus was not certain whatmight have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.""(UCP means ""unified combatant command"" like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)]The Mullen briefing and Petraeus's request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus's request thatCENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied (""it was dead on arrival"" a Pentagon officer confirms)the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issuesending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with thechief of the Israeli General Staff Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen's tripfocused on Iran the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt and tough message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: thatIsrael had to see its conflict with the Palestinians ""in a larger regional context"" -- as having a direct impact on America'sstatus in the region. Certainly it was thought Israel would get the message.Israel didn't. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahugovernment was building 1600 new homes in East Jerusalem the administration reacted. But no one was more outragedthan Biden who according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth engaged in a private and angry exchange with theIsraeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached toPetraeus's Mullen briefing: ""This is starting to get dangerous for us"" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. ""What you're doinghere undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and itendangers regional peace."" Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: ""The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since manypeople in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy any decision aboutconstruction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety ofAmerican troops fighting against Islamic terrorism."" The message couldn't be plainer: Israel's intransigence could costAmerican lives.There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA the American Medical Association the lawyers -- and theIsraeli lobby. But no lobby is as important or as powerful as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits mightreflect that Joe Biden's trip to Israel has forever shifted America's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region the realbreak came in January when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America'srelationship with Israel is important but not as important as the lives of America's soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the messagenow.Mark Perry's newest book is Talking To Terroristshttp://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment aswell as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Isthere any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda whether that is a desire to expandCENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel.I won't name my sources even though it's clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — whothey are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in thebriefing — the two briefers Admiral Mullen and Admiral Mullen's primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for thereader to determine. The account is not only accurate it's a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more toit. The White House State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account and for good reason: it's true.Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff Four Stars isthe authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. Ihave never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that GeneralPetraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhancetheir own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his countryand he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test ofGeneral Petraeus's loyalty to Israel but of his and our concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.It is perhaps a sign of the depth of ""the Biden crisis"" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated intowhether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel's security. This isn't about Israel's security it's aboutour security.http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and-netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/Netanyahu and Pastor Hagee's Lovefest on Eve of Biden'sArrival in IsraelOn 03.09.10 By Max(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.)Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved theconstruction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden's mission tohelp jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset hisplans by Netanyahu's appearance with John Hagee.The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu and a daybefore Biden's arrival Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee'sNight To Honor Israel an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations toIsraeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel's perceived enemies.At the gathering Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ""the Hitler of the Middle East"" and denouncedthe Goldstone Report as ""character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.""Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem a city he described as ""the undividedeternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then he told them ""I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!"" He used the rest ofhis speech to call for ""tough biting sanctions"" against Iran that ""bite deep into its energy sector.""Hagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage:r--XIn the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem MayorNir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin the chief rabbi of the illegalWest Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend fugitivebillionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressionaldelegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.Part One of Hagee's speech:XPart Two.XPastor Hagee in Jerusalem 3/8/10 (Part II) from Max J Blumenthal on Vimeo.Hagee's ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries thattotaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion andShomron which was involved in promoting an ""Obama Hilltop project"" that promoted more settlement building andcompared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated fromGush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel's assault on Gaza in 2009 a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israelgovernment to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region.Who is Hagee funding in Israel?XWho Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo.The most notable of Hagee's funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of thisgroup appeared in the film to thank Hagee for ""help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path the pathof Zionism the love of Israel the path of solidarity."" Another student called for ""the second revolution in Israel.""In February Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director NaomiChazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New IsraelFund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report.The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israelihuman rights groups. Meanwhile the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy acolumnist for Ha'aretz called Im Tirtzu ""a McCarthyite movement"" for its attacks on Chazan.Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu's campaign the organization's appearance during CUFI'sJerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.Republican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign afterHagee's statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said thathe believed the anti-Christ was ""partially Jewish as was Adolph Hitler."" However none of Hagee's comments havedeterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity.During Hagee's speech he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source ofdifficulties between the US and Israel. ""The settlements are not the problem"" he boomed from the podium. ""The problemis the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East.""Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when heproclaimed ""World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do inthe city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build who can and and cannotlive there.""The following day on March 9 Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials fromthe Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw ""a moment of real opportunity."""

"FROM MRS. JOCELYN MOMODU.NO 102 16TH STREET,ORANGE GROVEJOHANNESBURG 2001SOUTH AFRICA.TEL; +27-82-7656-212.Email; Jocelyn_momodu@walla.comDear,After due deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US$25 Million (Twenty five Million United States Dollars) First, let me start by introducing myself, I am Mrs. Jocelyn Momodu, a mother of three children and a widow from democratic republic of Congo.My husband Major James Momodu was a major in the democratic republic of Congo army, and was heading the procurement department of the army, in purchase of the arms and ammunitions for the war, in our country under the government of the Late LAURENT KABILA, who was killed by the security agent.For some years now we�ve been living in South Africa as asylum seekers, and we have been favoured with refugee status under the South African government umbrella after my husband�s death on the 5th of April 2005.Before the death of former the [D.R.C.] president Mr. Laurent Kabila, my husband was assigned to buy ammunitions worth of USD$25 MILLION DOLLARS from the South African arms manufacturing company. But on the processes of his negotiations with this firm in Johannesburg, the news of the president�s death came to him. Automatically he sees no reasons to continue with the negotiations and use the opportunity to divert the fund in his possession. For our personal gain. As he thought it�s of no use fighting for selfish power and killing innocent people of my country, many has already lost their lives and properties in the long war. Millions has also left their homes and seek asylum all over the world. Majority of the government personals has diverted millions of the country�s funds to their foreign account overseas.As a matter of fact we have no other option than to deposit this fund as it is sealed in a diplomatic box into a private security and finance company for safekeeping here in Johannesburg for my own use and seek for political asylum. And since then we�ve been living as asylum seekers in this country. After our refugee�s status was granted the refugee status prior to my husband�s sudden death, I contacted a bank last week to open an account and request for my possible investment in South Africa, as I do not think of going to back to my county. I was surprise as the bank told me that I would not invest this money myself due to my political status. I was told that am not allowed to invest or operate any business. The bank manager advised that I did better look for a foreign investor who will come to South Africa, open a non-residence investment account where the fund will be deposited and transferred out of South Africa to his or her account overseas. Due to the fact that I cannot invest this fund in South Africa as a result of my political status. I want your assistance in clearing this money from the security firm. Whereby standing as the soul beneficiary.For your assistance, I am offering you USD5 Million (Five million United States Dollars Only) however, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with the money when transferred into your account. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency contact me at the contact number or you may alternatively send me an email on my  private email address at; Jocelyn_momodu_01@excite.com.If you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine and okay by me. His chambers will be representing my interest with you. I will also like you to give me your contact address or private telephone; fax and email to enable my Attorney call or reach you from time to time. Please I do not need to remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality of this transaction if we must succeed.  Note that this transaction is risk 100% free as all arrangements have been made for a successful deal with my lawyer and the bank director involved. If you do not feel comfortable with this proposal, do not hesitate to discontinue. Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family. Yours faithfully,Mrs. Jocelyn Momodu. "

From my investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  HAJI EL JAMAL ZOUE, a citizen of Lebanon who died on the recent plane crash in Cotonou Benin republic on the 26th of Dec. 2003 You can seach the Webside.site;http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html )I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to claim the money as next of kin to the Late Mr  HAJI EL JAMAL ZOUE, meaning that no one is aware of the account.I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the account. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed undera legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.

"HelloThis letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium.As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation. I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital. Note that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you. "

Fervent and valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of the Walter Min's family or relatives but all proved non-avail.

"FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY). I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of mutual benefit. I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us. "

I can't remember but don't I have some Karzai event? If not what is he doing then?
There are a number of different possibilities for how the decision on the Guinea/Madagascar credentials may gotomorrow. (It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that wewould not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to.We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment the guidance is tovote to credential all countries — including these two — as is customary while conducting outreach with TanzaniaZambia and the AU to exnlain that WP have our own imnpratives hut ma cunnnrt thp fart that they are taking aprincipled stand.We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision which would allow them to be seated and vote but would notformally grant credentials. For the moment the guidance is to potentially support such a motion — this was the practicewith respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this.Ultimately however the whole thing may die of its own weight. This is probably the most likely outcome.

"Sorry to contact you in this manner. Difficulties encountered in efforts to secure funds inherited from my fathers business reserve, necessitate this search for someone to assist me.My name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to Sani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some money held in accounts in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Jersey and in Switzerland. In return, all criminal proceedings against members of my family be dropped ( a deal which was brokered by the international community).To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through a courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since  the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our properties.The money has since been deposited with a private finance andsecurity firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to you. All other information required to secure the funds will be given to you pending a positive response.A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers will be highly appreciated.Sincerely yoursMohammed Abacha"

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his wife and two children in July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.                          You can also confirm this in the website as follow:                      http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stmIt is therefore upon this discovery that I in my department now decided to make this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after  five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 27% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,3% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 70% would be for me and my colleague, after which we shall  visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank, and send your account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where  the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance maneger,for easy execution of the transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply.

On further investigation, I found out that he died Without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of China, at the expiration of eight (8) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to assist me in receiving this money as I have every machinery set to enable you receiver this money via a Finance firm based overseas. I need your urgent assistance so that this money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will require you to send me your complete names, contact address and telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to apply for the necessary documents to enable you receive the money via the Finance firm overseas in your name. After receiving the money, we will share in the ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you. Note that the project will be 100% risk free. Considering my position as the credit officer of the bank, I guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. I have the facilities to obtain relevant documents to enable me lift the money from the bank overseas. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I will also let you have the contact details of the Finance Firm and the country it is located in Overseas.

"MY REQUESTIn order to transfer out ( fifteen-million pounds sterlings) from our Bank here in london. I have the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.I am, Mr Jim Harry. the Auditor and head of computing department of a Bank here in scotland united kingdom. there is an account opened in this bank in 1995 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if i do not remitt this money out urgentely, It will be forfeited for nothing.How the money came about:The owner of this account is, Mr Lewis Mowan, A foreigner and manager of petrol chemical service here in london, A chemical engineer by proffession and he died since 2001 and then, Since 2001 nobody knows about this account or anything concerning it, The account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (15,000,000.00) pounds sterlings. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with a foreign account as the real beneficiary.Finally, At the conclusion of this business you will be given 25% of the total ammount,5% will be for expenses both parties might have incured during the process of this transaction.Your urgent respons is needed.Thanks.Mr Jim Harry."

"Foreign Exchange DepartmentFirst National Bank South Africa.DR. Taofeek Marvin.taofeekmarvin@netscape.net  Dear Friend,I,DR Taofeek Marvin, the Director of Bills  & Exchange of the foreignRemittance Department at  FIRST NATIONAL  BANK SOUTH AFRICA. I got your address while searching for trustworthy individuals in various countries. In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of $25, 5 million US Dollars in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died with his family in the September 11th plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come to our bank and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as a next of kin or relative to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed relatives died in the same plane crash leaving no relative behind to claim the fund. It is upon this discovery that l and other officials in my department decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relative to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to go into our bank treasury as an unclaimed fund. The banking law and guidelines here stipulate that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds. The request for a foreigner as a relative for this claim is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a South African cannot claim this fund as next of kin.We agreed that 20% of this money will go to the foreign partner who will supply the foreign account, 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction and 75% will be for me and my colleagues. Thereafter and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement of the percentages as indicated above.If you are interested to assist in this transaction, kindly contact the writer on the above mobile number or private e-mail address. Please this transaction is risk free and you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for transfer.Yours Faithfully,DR  Taofeek MarvinBill & Exchange Director"

"My Dear,I am Mrs Aicha Ahmed, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa.In my department we discoveredan abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2003 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learntthat all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behindfor the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the banktreasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 50% be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country fordisbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must applyfirst to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be transfer.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail,Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Mrs Aicha Ahmed."

"sbwhoeopTuesday November 17 2009 8:57 AMHFYI: Lead FT editorial today must if you haven't read. SidFinancial Times FT.comOMMENTeditorialUS fumbling for a new China tonePublished: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39Gone are the days when the US president could visit Beijing as the unassailable top dog able to lecture the Chinese oneverything from human rights to an overvalued currency. As has become fashionable to note events have instead obligedBarack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan.That analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just howdependent the US has become on foreign creditors chief among them China.It has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway the relative decline of a US-centric west andthe relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China poor and riddled with internalcontradictions is not there yet by a very long way.The changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumblingfor the right one. Take global imbalances.In the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is notabandoning Tokyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business asusual. ""One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on Americanconsumers and Asian exports to drive growth"" he said.That is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publiclysceptical about the US's long-term finances.From China's perspective Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans tospend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place.That explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay forhealthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary as well as fiscal policy.On the eve of the US president's visit Liu Mingkang China's chief banking regulator took a swipe at the US FederalReserve saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is abit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent ofgross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it canaddress a humbled superpower.Mr Obama's efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism particularlyhis decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres.His administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business-oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction.When it comes to human rights too the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth itschief creditor.Hillary Clinton secretary of state set the tone early when she said that human rights should not ""interfere"" with matters ofimplicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyospeech. There was also not a single mention of India a potential regional counterweight to China yet another indicationthat Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear MrObama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday — though even that could notundo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip.It is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's riseneed not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to commonperception China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependentChinese growth has been on the US consumer.Equally any idea that China with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the sameas Angola's can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not — andmust not — kowtow.Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2009. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

On the first we have shared with them all of our intel on likelyRepublican votes. I think they know we are now well north of 67 votes. On the second we have confirmed with theparliamentarian that we can move from the treaty to the appropriations bill by consent or with a simple majority vote.So if we begin start on tuesday night there is a way to get both measures done by the weekend. We will keep working itwith Reid staff and floor staff over the weekend. If you have any reason to speak with Durbin (he's on sunday shows) orschumer I'm sure that would help too.

"Falomo Complex, Ikoyi- Lagos.dglobalfax@yahoo.comI am Edwin Useni, a director in the project and planning department of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), I head a seven man Tenders Board Committee in charge of contract award and Payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (NNPC) among which were;  1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation - US$2 Billion.  2) Contract for Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of various Refineries in the country.  3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots)-US$94 Million.  The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced in the sum of Twenty Five million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars US$25,500,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount into your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed in you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 15% of the transferred sum, 5% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance to us in due course.  You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions; our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.  Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry 0f Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above terms.  Our assurance is that your role shall be totally risk-free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of funds, the whole procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide final beneficiary.  Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years in the Civil Service of my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite immediate action as we are well behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the second batch of the 2001 fiscal year contract payments.  BEST REGARDS.

Before my father�s death he disclosed to me some information about a total sum of USD 22,000,000.00 (Twenty Two Million  United States Dollars only) that was to be used for purchase of farming machinery equipment for Zimbabwean cooperative union of which he was the president. Unfortunately, he could not proceed with the purchase because the land problem aroused again when President Robert Mugabe started his new land act project which woolly affected all the rich farmers in Zimbabwe. As a result of this development, my wife and I decided to move to South Africa where we are now seeking Political asylum and the clause in my asylum status does not allow me to operate any banking transaction. After the death of my father, I quickly made arrangement to deface and smuggle the money into South Africa through diplomatic means. To reduce the cost of deposit and risk, the actual content of the box was not disclosed to the security company but instead the box was deposited as precious items valued at that amount. In view of these you will understand that my father�s death was politically motivated and this made me not to wish to invest this money in any African country. My only option is to seek for your assistance and if willing, you are required to come down to South Africa to open A NON-RESIDENT/ DOLLAR BANK ACCOUNT on your name where this money will be deposited for wire transfer into your nominated account overseas. If you are willing to assist in this regards, I worked out 25% of the total sum for your assistance rendered, 5% set aside for whatever financial expenses encountered in the process of transferring this money outside South Africa and 70% for myself and family. Be rest assured that this business is 100% risk free because I have worked out all modalities for the smooth transfer of this money to your chosen nominated account. I require an absolute secrecy and confidentiality for my security and for the successful transfer of this money (this happen to be a very important condition to offer). I will travel back with you to your country and take my share of 70% or alternatively, invest my share in your country under your supervision into any profitable business venture.  Kindly contact me with the following data:1. Your complete profile. 2. Your specific business/ investment offer, and other areas of investment you can readily make available  3. Your personal telephone and fax no for confidentiality of this deal. Best regards,MR GIBSON FERNANDO. "

"Good day, This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law. I am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. The present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family.This man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family.All their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day. His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope ofhatred to my client's family. Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently. Presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence.Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. All we require from you is to help the familyto go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions.Secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies. As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you withall the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together. We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. Please do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my securedemail:clem-aputa@earthling.net I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better. Regards, Clement Apute. Esq. "

Okay- I just left. Lew and patraeus are both there.
MS tomorrow you were scheduled to have a pre-brief prior to the Netanyahu meeting which included Senator Mitchell.Would you like to still see him (he was scheduled around 12:30pm)?Lona ValmoroSpecial Assistant to the Secretary of Statedirect)
Well Philippe looks right again. CNN is reporting this as being done against my wishes. Any way to salvage?
Madame Secretary:Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and RicardoLagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point it appears wehave a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C. stop in Miami to pick up RicardoLagos and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubtabout our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates itsAmerica's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday Representative Connie Mack didthe same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough stalwart guy. Heand his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.Finally we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identifyfurther opportunities for your engagement.I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key momentsand take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented adebilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of ourefforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us and for that we are grateful to you.RegardsTom

"WASHINGTON (CNN) — Fewer than three in 10 Americans think Sarah Palin's qualified to be president according to anew national poll - the least of any of the five potential candidates included in the survey.But another woman tops that list in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday: two-thirds of thepublic thinks that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's qualified for the Oval Office. That's more than Vice President JoeBiden who's currently next in line for the presidency.According to the poll 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House with seven in 10 saying theformer Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified.The survey indicates that a majority of Republicans 54 percent feel Palin is qualified with 44 percent indicating sheisn't. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president with 68 percentdisagreeing. According to the poll nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified.The poll's release comes one day before the release of Palin's book ""Going Rogue: An American Life.""""The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOPnomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.According to the survey nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president with 43 percent feelingthe same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63percent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified 9 points higher than the number that say the same ofPalin.""Palin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician that shecares about average Americans and that she is honest and trustworthy"" says Holland. ""But the perception that she isnot qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel.""An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Mondayindicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palin's qualified to serve as president with six in 10 saying she's not qualified.The CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Biden's qualified to take over as president.Biden's lownumber may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Bidenpersonally.""In the past poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president"" sayHolland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president but only ifrespondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications headds. In the Bush administration the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as theadministration grew more unpopular. ""Cheney's experience in office didn't change during that period - attitudes towardthe Bush/Cheney administration did"" he says.Hillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates including health carethe economic stimulus and other controversial matters while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policyHolland adds while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - ""which might explain why somerespondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep.""The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15 with 1014 adult Americans questioned bytelephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample."

"I am Hon. Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking, my agitation is real, and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila, in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually, his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions, as he believed.As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director, Safety and Security Department, we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad, that will stand as, the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion, since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.In addition, you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer, but only if, by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself, according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance, which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.Best regards,Hon.

Robert Mugabe to claim all the white -owned farms to his party members and his followers,he ordered all the  white farmers to surrender  all their farms to his party members and his followers.My father being one of the few rich and successful black farmers in our country was also victimised because of his opposition to Mugabe's policies. And because he did not support Mugabe's ideas,Mugabe's supporters  invaded my fathers farm and burnt everything in the farm,killing my  father and  made away with a  lot of items in my father's farm.However with the benefit of hingsight, owing to the looming but deteriorating crisis in my country Zimbabwea,my  father had, before his unfurtunate death deposited with one of the Security Company in Johannesburg ,  SOUTH AFRICA the  sum of US$18 Million (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED DOLLARS )After the death of my father,we decided  to move to the Republic of  South Africa where he had deposited the money in the Security Company as valuables.So I decided to contact overseas firms and individuals that will assist me to move this money out of  South Africa because, as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any bank accont within South Africa.We have agreed to offer 15% of the total sum for your assistance,5% will mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred  in the course of this transaction and 80% will be for me and my family to Invest in your country.Please,I need the following clarifications from you:1.

A quick reference of Newswe=ek publication of March 13th 1999 were 88million dollars was taken from u=s will give you an insight of what I have gone through. After a short whi=le I was arrested and detained in prison custody,&nbsp; the government ca=me up with a trump up charge against me and honestly speaking I have been= in detention since November 1999 and I was only released on Thursdays (1=1-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria who passed judgment in my favor.=</DIV><BR><DIV>During the reign of my father as the president of this c=ountry, an Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was reve=aled.

"It seems to me that Clegg feels he's weak can't form a grand progressive coalition--the Lib Dems have LOST seats--Clegg's so-called ""modernizing"" has failed. So Clegg is saying no deal with Labour Tories must govern without acting ontheir program. He's plalying for another election relatively soon perhaps a year hoping to do better but will do evenworse having played the spoiler. And if Labour goes out so does Gordon and Labour will have a new face probablyDavid. Sid="
I'm usually the pessimist but I'm not sure this is as dire as it seems in the moment from 10000 miles away.First the world/media is fixated on the President's speech the imagery from Riyadh dominates there's no Hondurasfootage of interest which is key. Speech tomorrow will blanket coverage and extinguish the Cuba stuff so we just needto weather the night.Second Tom & Dan did an on the record conf call not long ago and we think they did very well. Dan was especiallystrong and he's also speaking to people 1:1Third your statement was strong and the reporting will catch up with it it's only been out 90 minutes.Fourth we are suffering from two significant tactical problems: 1) you are here and removed 2) our press corps was outof position today and in flight so the people we worked on all week and the ones likely to skew our way were replacedby reporters not connected to us.The two issues above will be rectified tomorrow in your two interviews - especially Greta who is malleable. We can usethat to make a strong case on the principle and the simple fact Cuba wasn't in the OAS yesterday and won't betomorrow. Everyday that passes reinforces that point. The time difference to East Coast will help us in movingwhatever is said in these interviews tomorrow.Short term we started the week showing we can engage with Cuba (mail migration) and ending it showing we areserious about our redlinesLong term we stood up for human rights and that can only be a plus.
"Dear........., PROVISION OF BANK ACCOUNT TO DEPOSIT FUNDS"" Please accept my sincere apology if my email does notmeet your business or personal ethics. I will firstintroduce myself as DR.EVERES HENRY, a staff in theaudit section of a well-known bank, here in London,England. One of our accounts, with holding balance of�26,000,000 (Twenty Six Million Pounds Sterling) hasbeen dormant and last operated three years ago. Frommy investigations and confirmation, the owner of thesaid account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda diedon the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash inBirmingham; you can view this CNN website:(http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/)fordetails on the crash. Since then, nobody has doneanything as regards the claiming of this money, as hehas no family member that has any knowledge as to theexistence of either the account or the funds; and alsoinformation from the National Immigration also statesthat he was single on entry into the UK. After detailed investigations on the deceased and hisaccount, I found out there is no mention of any heirsor family member on the account document in the Bankrecords, therefore the money was lodged secretly intothe account. Plans are to transfer the fund out withyour sincerely help.This transaction is totally free of risk and troublesas the fund is legitimate and does not originate fromdrug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegalact. On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY.I look forward to hear from you soonest.

"From John Beyerle ... Perhaps the Russians won't send troops:I just called Karasin. He agreed that the situation had gotten worse in Osh and Jalalabad today but said the Russianposition is still that sending in foreign troops whether Russian or CSTO will be counterproductive and lead to moreviolence and bloodshed.The IL-76s that flew in to Kant today were the EMERCOM/M4C planes he told me about yesterday; they havehumanitarian cargo primarily doctors and medical equipment. I cited the news reports that a battalion of paratroopershad gone in -- he said there may be some troops on board to guard the plane or beef up security at Kant but he wasfirm that at this point Russia has no plans to introduce its own forces in the south. The main objective was to stop theviolence through peaceful means; Russia had provided the Kyrgyz forces with additional ""technical means"" foraccomplishing that. He said they hoped this would help Kyrgyz forces get control of the situation which was their maingoal.I asked about CSTO planning and possible UN or OSCE PKFs. He said there is no formal CSTO meeting plannedalthough people are consulting via phone. He repeated their hesitation to see any CSTO deployments. They have notyet considered UN or OSCE PKFs but if the situation continues to deteriorate he wouldn't exclude the possibility.Rushailo is currently in Moscow but may be sent to Bishkek tomorrow or Tuesday. He agreed to call me if there is anymajor change in the situation on the ground or regarding force deployments. Tomorrow is a Russian holiday but he'llhave his cell phone on."

"H: 58 days left. Whether the Democrats have the ability and will to execute is a separate subject: ""If it were done when'tis done then 'twere well it were done quickly..."" Making Boehner the GOP poster child should be systematic andrelentless. Tick tock another day gone. SidSeptember 3 2010Americans Most Likely to Favor GOPNewcomers for CongressThree in four believe influx of new members would improveCongressby Jeffrey M. JonesPRINCETON NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice offour hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience Americans are most likely to prefer ""aRepublican who has not served in Congress."" Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent overa newcomer.These results based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll underscore the advantageous political environment forRepublicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall a majority of Americans prefer a Republicancandidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardlessof party affiliation) to an incumbent 54% to 39%.The fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voterswant both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washingtonexperience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates on the other hand apparently are more satisfied with the typeof experienced representatives now in Congress.One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates and Republicans to prefer Republicancandidates and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versuschallengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress and thusmore Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is inCongress to a Democrat who is not and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to onewho is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents.The data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specificcandidates for Congress. This fall voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democraticcandidate one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for theRepublican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today 48% of Americanssay the Republican and 43% the Democrat.The appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congresswould be changed for the better if ""most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members."" Only 14%think that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting stronganti-incumbent sentiment.Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most memberswere turned out of office. However there is a significant gap by political party with 89% of Republicans versus 63% ofDemocrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again the difference likely stems fromDemocrats' current status as the majority party in Congress.ImplicationsIn a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president andCongress it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected inAmericans' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for inthis fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greaterseat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular."

"Private/ConfidentialDear friend, I regret any inconvenience I could have caused by contacting you with my business proposal.However,  this is something that I need the assistance of a foreign partner to carry out successfully, hence this communication with you.I would like you to  providing advisory assistance and services, you are also going to assist in receiving by bank transfer to your account the funds to be utilized for the proposed investments.  The total amount involved is eighteen million five hundred thousand Dollars (US), which, after we reached recessary agreement, shall be transferred through the overseas banking agent of Central Bank of my country (The Gambia). The fund is presently waiting to be transferred to any foreign beneficiary confirmed by us to them as our overseas associate.  Our proposal is that after you receive the funds,  you will receive a one-off commission of 20% of the total amount transferred.  The remaining 80% for me and my partners will be used for various forms of legitimateinvestments in your country.  However, this is optional, and should it not beconvenient for you to further assist us with investing the money, we can end our cooperation after you make available to me our 80% of the money. Our proposed venture with you is absolutely legitimate, with approval of regulatory authorities in my country,  and the money will be transferred to your account with all necessary back-up documents showing legitimate source/origin of fund. The transfer will be effected to your account within seven (7) working day as soon as we reach an agreement and you furnish me with a suitable bank account for receiving the money.Please, get back to me asap with your confirmation that you are ready to co-operate and work with us as outlined above.  Any suggestions which you may have for facilitating the transaction successfully from your side are welcome.regards,Azeez Cumoo."
"AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.Attention Please,I am Mr Mohamat Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,Mr Mohamat Ali."

"FYI:Jan 12 2010» Mobile Home » Top StoriesInside the Reid eruptionBy Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM ESTHarry Reid isn't talkative. But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authorswho came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the 2008 election.They — and their tape recorder — were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned abackbencher in his caucus into president of the United States.Reid wasn't on guard — perhaps because he'd been told by his staff that the meeting would be ""off the record""according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.Although Reid is a master of the Senate's mysterious inside game he's often botched the outside game because of whatone colleague calls a ""penchant for saying things without a filter.""But Jim Manley Reid's senior communications adviser wasn't too worried as he and his boss sat down with JohnHeilemann of New York Magazine and Mark Halperin of Time magazine — two veteran reporters who were working onwhat their publisher had billed as ""a sweeping novelistic and ultimately definitive portrait"" of the 2008 race.Like virtually every Washington political insider Manley had a long and warm relationship with Halperin the longtimepolitical director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with ""The Note.""Maybe Reid and Manley — thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years — simply assumed thatHalperin wouldn't burn him or his boss. Or maybe he expected that Halperin would check back with him on any quoteshe planned to use?Whatever they were thinking they were wrong.Reid was talking about the reasons why even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democraticprimaries of 2008 he had secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to challenge another member of hiscaucus then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid all the talk of Obama's oratorical gifts he let slip something else:Obama could win the White House because he was a ""light-skinned"" African-American ""with no Negro dialect unless hewanted to have one.""The authors write in ""Game Change"" published this weekend that Reid had made the remark ""privately."" They did notsay he had said it to them.As a chagrined Reid telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support thisweekend he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors.In the book's""Authors' Note"" they wrote: ""All of our interviews — from those with junior staffers to those with thecandidates themselves — were conducted on a 'deep background' basis which means we agreed not to identify thesubjects as sources in any way. We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sortdepends.""Heilemann said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"": ""We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviewswould be on deep background.... Our ground rules are ... that we won't identify any of our sources as the sources of thematerial. But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book if they were utteringdialogue to people in the book in part of a scene that we would identify them as the utterer of those words.""Halperin added: ""There's no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way or violated any agreement with.""Manley a Capitol Hill veteran who also had worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy had been responsible for monitoringthe interview and dealing with issues arising from it.But he didn't tell anyone else in Reid's inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made; because of hisgood relationship with the authors he assumed that the quotes would never be made public — at least not without hisknowing about it first.Manley declined comment on this story-- and wouldn't confirm if the interview took place.On Friday at 10 p.m. — half a year after the interview — The Atlantic's Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reid's staff withquestions about a ""light-skinned"" candidate without a ""Negro dialect.""In the second-guessing that followed Capitol Hill veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from aSenate majority leader would remain off the record even if that had been the arrangement.But because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm he and the rest of the damage-control squad were caught flat-footed by Ambinder's e-mail several people close to the situation told POLITICO.""They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince Halperin not to run it"" said a Democrat whoparticipated in some of the damage control.Now the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that if mishandled could be politically fatal. Manley and otheraides worked until 2 a.m. Saturday to draft Reid's carefully written apology which emphasized his record on African-American issues.""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words"" the 90-word statement began.Later on Saturday Manley helped lead a counteroffensive calling White House press secretary Robert Gibbs a friendfrom his days as communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to set up an apology callbetween Reid at home in Searchlight Nev. and Obama back in Washington.In a stunning ""Statement by the President"" e-mailed to reporters at 3:55 p.m. Saturday Obama said: ""Harry Reid calledme today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today.... As far as I'm concerned the book is closed.""Relieved to have the president's solid backing Reid's aides decided that their toughest challenge would be to preventany prominent African-American Democrats from attacking Reid too harshly — or calling for his resignation.Reid's team correctly anticipated that Republicans would demand his head. Keeping that criticism from becoming abipartisan drumbeat was the key. The team calculated that as long as the attacks looked like partisan shouting Reidwould benefit.Aides say their boss quickly understood the danger and spent much of Saturday working a call list of about 30 prominentAfrican-Americans across the country. On the calls he apologized for his words and argued that the book's maintakeaway should be that he had quietly supported Obama over Clinton long before those made his feelings public.Among those he called were the Rev.

But byMonday Reid believed the Washington storm was passing. From his home in New York Sen. Chuck Schumer telephonedReid in Nevada and offered to organize a letter of support from all the Democratic senators.Reid decided that was unnecessary.

"I NEED YOUR QUICK RESPONSECalvary GreetingsI am a preacher with the Seed Harvest Ministry,and I will like to get advicefrom you.I believe the advice I need is secular to some extent, but do havethe patience to understand my intention.  A few year's ago I was in Baghdad,Iraq where I had established a littlecongregation where I preached regularly,but the war escaleted and the churchwas converted to a hospital of soughts. Before then, On one faithfull daythree American Soldiers came to me and left a trunk box of Money with me andswore to come back for it.  When the war in Iraq intensified I was escorted to My country Benin RepublicWest africa, by the U.S soliers who felt the content of the trunk box waschurch documents and never cared to check the trunk box,, when I was getting fraustrated I returned to Iraq only to find out that two of the three Soldiersdied in Battle while the last was decleared MIA (Missing in Action).  Now I have the fund which belongs to the soldiers and which is Eight millionus dollars ($8,000.000.00),but i have deposited it with a security companyhere in my country Benin Rep, and I was contacted in a letter dated 10th ofMay.2006 by the company asking me to indicate if I was in reciept of theletter as a sign that I am still living and still subscribed for theirservice.  I am interested in using a small fraction of this money,much less than tenpercent for a re-organisation of the work, but I do not need the rest and donot want to have any direct dealing with it, I need someone who will be ableto use the fund better maybe for charity or something universally profitable,I have thought of doing it my self but, my ministry is the apocalypse and Ibelieve and preach the soon comming  which make me not indulgent in relianceon money or wealth in any form.  I also do not have the money that has accrued on the service and safe depositof the company that holds the trunk box, I will be glad if you have anyinterest in the direction of maybe managing or transmitting the fund as youprefer in your capacity like using it to help the motherless and people in the3rd world countries. I will like you to give me your phone  number for easy and good communication.  I will be glad to get aresponse from you through my direct email address pastor_jonesbell@mail.ru  Regards.Pastor Jones Bell----------------------------------------------------------------------------���� �� �������� ""�������""! ���������� �� ���������� ����� ����� �������!���������� ������ � ���������� �������� �� ������������ ��������!���. 563-0-563, 566-77-22http://www.adamant.ua/"

"  ACCOUNT.  My name is Mr.Jason Leicester and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.      At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his death,The Late Prime  Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United Kingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder,      Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 20,  2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to (http://www.hariri.info/)     I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.     Best Regards      Mr.Jason Leicester . 				---------------------------------Want to be your own boss?

"Please Pass to the SecretaryMadame SecretaryA shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM) resulting in the death of twobodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details but our understanding at this point is that it was anattempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. familieswere targeted the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area and this event in particular present avery high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help onunderstanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate inMonterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children toschool while we complete this security review.I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. Morebroadly if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control that may affect our ability tofunction in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this and have sought her help as well to address consulatesecurity.Consulate personnel are currently on ""authorized departure"" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.Carlos Pascual"

"Greetings from Nairobi. I'm at the end of week-long trip to Kampala Kinshasa and now Nairobi. The trip has been veryproductive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime I knowthat there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach toCVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overallapproach to strategic communications around the globe.As you and I have discussed it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. Toput it bluntly we are in an ""information war"" on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunitiesaround the world we must fight aggressively to get and maintain our fair share of ""consumer share of mind."" Both ouradversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways ofcommunicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in somecases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by ouradversaries we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and writtenabout the concept of ""soldier diplomats"". In the same vein I believe we must empower a corps of ""diplomat soldiers"" tohelp us gain ground in this new war.While countering violent extremism is and will remain a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply thesame level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive storiesabout the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past our failure to respond to attacks and distortions hasdiminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example had we not responded toall the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in Haiti I believe we would have provided a fertile field forAQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an ""invader"".Before I left for this trip I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much moreaggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our newregional PD DAS's and PAO's in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will workwith the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to requestthat you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilitiesin this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return.Finally we are developing new organizational solutions modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda whichI think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within theMission but across all government agencies within particular countries.I will continue to update you as we move forward.Hope your trip is going well. Look forward to greeting together when we are both back in DC.JM"

These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945).

Numbered accounts are also included.

"Reply to this email :( faith.dorman@jubii.dk)Dearest in the Lord,=20PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.I am the above named p=erson from Guinea Bissau. I am married to Dr Oputa Dorman who worked with= Guinea Bissau Embassy in South Africa for nine years before he died in t=he year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a=fter a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Christians and we lived happily.= Since his death, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my mat=rimonial home which the Bible is really against. When my late husband was= alive he secured $15Million (Fifteen Million U.S. Dollars) with a Vault =Company here in Cote d=92Ivoire. Presently, this money is still with the =Vault Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that from the entire test cond=ucted on my health, I am not going to last long, especially, due to my ca=ncer and stroke. But what disturbs me most now is stroke. Having known my= condition, I decided to donate this fund to churches or Christian indivi=dual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct. I want =a church or individual that will use this money to fund churches, Orphana=ges and Widows.Also, the propagation of the work of God, building and maintaining the ho=use of God through this money, is very important. The Bible made us to un=derstand that Blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision becaus=e I don=92t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband re=latives are not Christians. I don=92t want my husbands hard earned money =to be misused by unbelievers, for their own selfish interest and in an un=godly manner. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I k=now that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says= that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.=20I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my h=ealth, and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me som=etimes. I don=92t want them to know about this development, but I know th=at With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I sh=all give you the contact of the Vault Company in Cote D' Ivory. I will al=so give you all information regarding the deposit of this money, and issu=e you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- benefi=ciary of this fund. Meanwhile, I will want you and your church to always =pray for me because God work in mysterious ways. My happiness is that I l=ived a life of a worthy Christian. Who ever that wants to serve the Lord =must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all throug=h your life.Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Chr=istian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will a=ct accordingly as I stated herein.=20Hoping to hear from you soon. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.Yours in Christ,Mrs Faith OPUTA.- MRS FAITH OPUTA."

"CHALLENGE SECURITIES  AND FINANCE LTDLAGOS, NIGERIAATTENTION:SIRI am MR.ISA MUHAMEED, the Director of OperationsCHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here inNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high reputewith years of outstanding service to the people ofAfrica.I have resolved to contact you through thismedium based on business proposal that will be ofmutual benefit to both of us.I got your particulars through a consultant companybase on my research for atrustworthy and establishedperson that understands investment ethic for enteringinto a life time profitable joint partnershipinvestment and also co-operation with confidence andtrust that you willkeep the contents secret anddivulged to any third party.To be explicit and straight to the point. Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of ours depositedaconsignment in our company\'s vault for safekeeping.And since then our client has failed to comeforward to claim his consignment, which hasaccumulated aconsiderable amount of money indemurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact thisclient to redeem the demurrage which his consignmenthad accumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Sincethe death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,none of his benefactors has come forward to claim theconsignment with us, which means that non of hisrelatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment.Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open thetwo boxes that our client deposited in our vault. Andto my surprise I discovered that the two boxes thatwere registered as treasurer by our client actuallycontained a considerable amount of money in UnitedStates Dollars amounting to about US$30 millionDollar. Since this development I have been nursingplans secretly. I also found out from enquiries andthe foreign media that our late client siphoned a lotof money from his country while he was in office ashead of state.It is my conviction that the consignmentin our vault was part of the money that our clientsiphoned and now that he is dead there is no race tothis money in our care.I am now soliciting your nobleassistance to assist me in transferring this money outof nigeria to your country for immediate investmentwith your assistance.I have also decided that you willgenerously been titled to 30% of the total amount.Upon my receiptof your reply confirming yourwillingness to assist me of this transaction, I willimmediately arrange and transfer all the rights ofownership of this consignment to your name tofacilitate your easy clearance and transfer of thecomplete funds to yourcountry.you have nothing to worry about, as I will be thereto assist you in anyway necessary with all properdocumentation.This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintainabsolute confidentiality on this matter.Please reply to the above email address with yourtelephone and fax so can call you.Thanks.Yours faithfully.MR.ISA MUHAMEED__________________________________________________________________Get Tiscali Broadband From =A315:99http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadbandhome/"

"     We were married for fiften years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only two weeks . Before his death we are happy husband and wife Christian family. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was a live he deposited the sum of ( USD $1.Million ) (One Million U.S. Dollars)in the privet security company here in Cote d'Ivoire,This money still with the securyty company.     Recently, my Doctor told me that i have serious sickness which is Cadiac problem.The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to your church or individual that will utilize this money according to God's direction.I want your church to use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.     The Bible made us to know that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don�t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don�t want my husband�s efforts to be used by self acclaimed Christians.      I don�t want in a way that this money will be used ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision to hand you over this Fund. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the hand of the Lord Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my problems and I shall hold my peace.      I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my straint. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.Please do give urgent response to this mail without any delay.

I get these reports every morning. They are somewhat painful to read since as you know in Pakistan themedia can be particularly outrageous. However we can't ignore the fact that these talk shows are the mostwatched programming in prime time.. The report below is fairly typical. The host sets up the discussion infairly provocative way and the guests who come from across the political spectrum respond. As you cansee the first commentator is strongly anti US. However what I have observed since our media offensivebegan last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest as well who will argue along the lines that it isonly natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better job of protecting Pakistan. Believe itor not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things we do. Also on occasionwhere there have been particularly egregious attacks on US policy the host will read a statement from ourEmbassy in the following programming. We try to get airtime on these programs whenever possible but it ishard. It 's a hard slog getting this right but we are making progress.im

"Goodday,You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don=92t know me =personally, I am DR RANI ALI JUMA, the first son of DR. OMAR ALI JUMA, and he =was the VICE PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA. Before he died, my father =died at the age of 63 in the year 2001 after addressing fellow TANZANIANS =during the visit of PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA of DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO =and YUERI MUSEVENI of UGANDA. I got your contact through the Ghana =information Exchange (G.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person = to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of =fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you.My late father was among the ruling party (CCM) which the opposition party =was dominated by his Muslim brothers led by PROF. IBRAHIM LIPUMBA. Before his =death he had taken to Europe  to deposit the sum of US$40 million (FORTY =MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and finance company as if he =foresaw the looming danger coming. The money was deposited in two sealed =boxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I =most say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to =go back to politics. For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA, never showed =any concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life =was no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana ,West Africa where I am =residing now with my own family.Meanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don=92t think of going back and for =this I and my family have decided to transfer my father=92s money into a =foreign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father, I am =saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where =this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who =have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of =African government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such =investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must =entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know =that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does =not necessarily matter.Therefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer =you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while =5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of =this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on =your advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you =would not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal =or company=92s account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.BEST REGARDSDR. RANI ALI JUMA.  --d6b9cac0-c60a-11d8-8772-0004aca2aa72--"

Strobe Talbott •Wednesday June 2 2010 6:21 PM'Cheryl Mills.; Jake Sullivan (DOS)follow up on Afghan matterHillary as promised I connected with Bruce Jones at NYU about Spanta. Bruce got in touch offered to help Spanta puttogether an arrangement at NYU that might have a Brookings offshoot. Spanta said he needed to decide with Karzaiwhether in fact the timing was right for him to leave. He just got back in touch with Bruce saying he's decided to stay ona bit longer. That said he's agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all itsounds as though this has ended up in the right place for now. Bruce Martin and I will be open to other NY/DCpossibilities down the road when Spanta's situation changes. Thanks again for the truly terrific event at Brookings.Regards Strobe

Rather curiously he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of StateHillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington.Contrary to his previous visit in March this time the US administration intends to create the impressionoutwardly at least that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between thetwo countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression the two leaders will meet the mediatogether and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time Netanyahu will also be put up at BlairHouse the official White House guesthouse and not at a hotel.That said officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide inthe course of the meeting which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at animpasse to direct negotiations. Obama apparently will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend theconstruction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PAChairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel. For the time being the forum of seven isdivided over this issue.Read more of this post"

"sbwhoeopWednesday August 25 2010 10:52 AMworth reading even if you know the IntelB6H: I'm sure you know the facts in this well-informed piece how Mullah Omar was saved by ISI for example but the ideaof Afghanistan as an aspect of lndo-Pak war is the best and overarching strategic concept. Sidhttp://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistaniNT aLOSEThe military and the mullahsWilliam DalrymplePublished 23 August 2010The Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.It is proving a fatal alliance.It May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country's inscrutable chief ofarmy staff the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.For a start the army's response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan's civilianpoliticians guided by their chateau-hopping president Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment he was nicknamed""Mr 10 Per Cent""; he has now been upgraded to ""Mr 110 Per Cent""). This has led to discussion in army circles aboutwhether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is thisthreat that one of the country's most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi editor-in-chief of the FridayTimes went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup.""( know this isdefinitely being discussed"" he said.Then there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: ""an extraordinarysituation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it"" explained a brigadier writing in the Nation newspaper.Kayani a former head of Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO can now continueto run the army and by default Pakistan's foreign policy until November 2013.But Kayani's biggest triumph this year arguably the greatest of his career was his visit to Kabul in July as the honouredguest of the Afghan president Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations whichhave been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah SalehKarzai's pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as amujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud the Indian-backed ""Lion of Panjshir"". The Taliban and their sponsors inthe ISI had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent something Saleh was enormously proud of.When I had dinner with him in Kabul in May he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai'sgovernment in taking the fight to the Taliban and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid arm and train itspuppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh's sacking gave notice of an important change of directionby Karzai. As Bruce Riedel Barack Obama's Af-Pak adviser said when the news broke ""it means that Karzai is alreadyplanning for a post-American Afghanistan"". •It seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-sponsored elements in the Taliban maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani which could give over much of the Pashtunsouth to pro-Pakistan Taliban but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of IndiaPakistan's great regional rival from Afghanistan or at least the closing of its four regional consulates would be a toppriority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks Pakistan's influence disappeared abruptly fromAfghanistan andIndia quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI's horror in the early years of this decade India provided reconstructionassistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads sanitation projects the new Afghan parliamentand free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As GeneralStanley McChrystal put it in a report last year ""while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people increasing Indianinfluence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures"".McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. ""Wehave strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan's interests to destabilise Pakistan"" a foreignministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan's military establishment terrified of the economic superpower emergingto the south believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - apotential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital""strategic depth"".According to Indian diplomatic sources there are still fewer than 3600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indiandiplomatic officers as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to riskPakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally the US in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership underISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis and hisclear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban therefore represents a majorstrategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan's military as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadimovements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin Pakistan's army saw violent Islamicgroups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with theretreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managedwith great effect from 1990 onwards).The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul who was largely responsible for developing the strategyonce said to me: ""If the jihadis go out and contain India tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil for alegitimate cause why should we not support them?"" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the BerlinWall presented to him by the city's people for ""delivering the first blow"" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis inthe 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his ""retirement"".The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a tapedconversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan his chief of general staff that Indiareleased in 1999 Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their ""tooti"" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followedtheir own agendas sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders buteven the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence againstIndian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim somuch as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs publicpromises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked onplans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai'sregime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabulonce the American gaze had turned elsewhere.So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. MullahMohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb ofPashtunabad. There Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.Gulbuddin Hekmatyar the leader of Hizb-e-lslami was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freelyoutside Peshawar while Jalaluddin Haqqani one of the most violent Taliban commanders was given sanctuary in NorthWaziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.By 2004 the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering thema few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistaniarmy officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agenciesconcluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban turning a blind eye as they raisedfunds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban with covert Pakistanisupport were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returnedto their bases in Pakistan.At the same time Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified beginning the process of turning theAfghan conflict like that in Kashmir into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twicebombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Researchand Analysis Wing (Raw) the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died inthe blasts.The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear and not just in thedocuments published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard basedon interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders closely documents how the IS! ""orchestrates sustains andstrongly influences"" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadershipcouncil the Quetta Shura.Meanwhile in the Punjab Hafiz Mohammad Saeed founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba and the man believed to have beenbehind the 2008 Bombay attacks has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke near Lahore. ""The powerfulwestern world is terrorising Muslims"" he told a conference in Islamabad this year. ""We are being invaded manipulatedand looted. We must fight the evil trio of America Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. Infact a suicide attack is the best form of jihad.""At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generousassistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both themilitants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley andannounced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others inthe Federally Administered Tribal Areas more than 1500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250000people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any membersof the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi in February of the Taliban second-in-command Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded asinfringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis without ISI clearance.Yet even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas the seventh NorthWaziristan has been left alone as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly Pakistan'sfoot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groupsin Pakistan over the past few months show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer the chiefminister of the Punjab Shahbaz Sharif was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in thePakistani Punjab or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still in the eyes of many in the Pakistaniestablishment good Taliban and bad Taliban useful militants and expendable ones.In their eyes the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan with US and British troops suffering record casualties lastmonth is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan andDelhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south and here India is workingin conjuction with Russia Iran and the central Asian ""stans"". The Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menonwas despatched to Afghanistan in March and the foreign minister S M Krishna has visited Tehran. Post-AmericanAfghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtunsouth either formally with a partition or more likely to slip into inter-ethnic civil war with India supporting and armingthe north and Pakistan the south.As diplomacy gathers pace the Afghan Taliban who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue toincrease their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peacefulnorth where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of theBritish aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.In Pakistan. too jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country killing roughly3000 people and the ISI this week stated that for the first time in the nation's history it regarded home-grown Islamicmilitants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In arecent speech Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy it was against Indian attacksthat he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis electricity supply increasingly erratic andthe educational system in complete breakdown Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget.It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests inthe region. Worst of all because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph it is unlikely to change its policy anytime soon.William Dalrymple's ""Nine Lives: in Search of the Sacred in Modern India"" won the first Asia House Literary Award inMay and is newly published in paperback (Bloomsbury £8.99)"

"Engr.Makalele Johnson.PretoriaSouth Africa.FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf ofmy colleagues. I got your information from a personal search in theinternet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit ofall parties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature ofthis business.Within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I workas a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operationof four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overduepayment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentageof the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by aforeign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoicedto the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five HundredThousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract costhas been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreigncontractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationswith foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.As a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operationof some officials at the Department of Finance and the ReserveBank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance asthe beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowedto operate a foreign account.

I  have contacted you to assist in repatrating the money  and property left behind by my client before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank  where this huge deposits were lodged, particularly, the CITI TRUST BANK where the deceased had an  account valued at about US$14.7million dollars . The bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated within the next ten officialworking days. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased sinceyou have the same last name  so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$14.7 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money.

"Dear Sir,I am Engr. Ugo Nzego with the Engineering Stores Department of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and member of Tenders Board. We have urgent need for a trustworthy foreign contact person with whom we can carry out a successful business deal.Federal Government has voted the sum of US$1.86 Billion for Local Production of food crops. The Government has also considered the impact of the importation of some food items like Rice, Beans, Frozen Chicken and Turkeys and other food stuffs on the Nations Foreign Reserve and have banned the importation of the items that could be produced locally. As a result, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources has been mandated to import Agricultural Equipments for supply to Local Farmers both at SUBSISTENT AND COMMERCIAL level to encourage them to produce enough food items for local consumption and for export to other African Countries. We have already started awarding new contracts for supply of the equipments to successful bidders.We want you to submit to us immediately your complete company name, address, your name as President or Managing Director / CEO of the company, your banking particulars:- (banks name address, telephone,fax and telex numbers. Your receiving number, swift and routing numbers), with these informations, we can get you properly registered as one of the contractors of FMANR who has already been awarded part of this contract for the sum of US$113.4 Million to supply some of the Agricultural Equipments parts of which we already have in our custody (stores).After receiving the above needed and stated information from you, we will process all the documentation and submit them for immediate approvals and the Federal Government will pay 25% of US$113.4 Million into your nominated bank account in the name of your company as the beneficiary, which is US$28.35M . In no time, the remaining US$85,050,000.00 Million shall be paid as balance payment or we together in agreement as partners will use another foreign firm's name that will carry out the supply of the remaining equipments as a sub-contractor to you in our documentation to receive this balance payment.We shall come to your country immediately this fund is in your account to share the US$28.35 Million. The sharing pattern should be negotiated by both parties concerned.However, be rest assured that no risk is involved or any scandal in the future, for we have done all our homework very well, nobody will be hurt during and after this transaction. It may also please you to knowthat all the GOODS that cover the 25% payment are on record, only us that are key members of the contract board committee has this knowledge and information. There is the serious need to keep this transactionsecret and very confidential. To that effect, I would require your private phone and fax numbers for easy and confidential communication. I await  your immediate response to this Proposal. Meanwhile, I look forward to establishing life long business relationship with you.The  nature of your company or business does not necessarily have to be Agriculturally related but ownership of a company is a criterium for the project.Please reply immediately through this fax number 234-9-2726567.

"CDear Friend,I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics, which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life, But please treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you in the best of health.Mr Alpha Kone the manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless   some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank treasury as   unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effectivecommunication and location where the money will be  transfer.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Mr Alpha Kone"

"Dear Sir,I am Mrs. Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasser Arafat, thePalestinian leader who died recently in Paris France.Since his death and even prior to the announcement,I have been thrown into a state of antagonism, confusion,humiliation,frustration and hopelessness by the presentleadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization andthe new Prime Minister headed by MAHMOUD ABBAS.I have even been subjected to physical and psychologicaltorture.As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidencewith everybody in the country at the moment. You must haveheard over the media reports and the Internet on the discovery of some fund in my husband secret bank account and companies and the allegations of some huge sums of money deposited by my husband in my name of which I have refuses to disclose or give up to the corrupt Palestine Government.And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman,more importantly when the woman is from a christian background,hence my desire for a foreign assistance.I and my late husband deposited the sum of 6.5 million dollars with a Financial firm in Europe/Canada whose name is withheld for now until we open communication.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your bank account for safe keeping and any Investment opportunity.This arrangement will be known to you and I alone and all our correspondence should be strictly on email alone because our government has tapped all my lines and are monitoring all my moves.In view of the above, if you are willing to assist for our mutual benefits, i promise to give you 30% of the $6,500,000 that will be kept in your position for a while and invested in your name for my trust pending when my Daughter, ZAHWA, will come off age and take full responsibility of her Family inheritance.Please note that this is a golden opportunity that comes once in life time and more so, if you are honest, I am going to entrust more funds in your care as this is one of the legacy we keep for our children. In case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security and international media as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.Yours sincerely,"

"DEAR,     MY NAME IS MR MR Ken Edward,A former government official of Liberia. Following the exit of president CharlesTaylor of Liberia from power under a West African brokered peace agreement, led by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo he was granted asylum by the Nigerian Government. In my position as the Financial Secretary to the President and close confidant, I left for Nigeria in his Entourage. My country has been engulfed in Protracted Civil war with rebels controlling some parts of the country. During the war, President Taylor disbursed large sums of Monies to buy the loyalty of the entire cabinet, and I can say with all modesty that I was one of the Chief Beneficiaries of this disbursement. This is aside from monies I used my official position to acquire while in office. Since we relocated to Calabar, Southern Nigeria all has been well, but with the recent indictment of former President Taylor by the war crime tribunal sitting in Sierra Leone and confirmed re ports of a dedicated fund by the American Government to capture him in order to face war crime charges have now decided to leave the country. Presently I have funds totaling United State $15,000,000.(Fifteen Million US Dollars) Which I intend to move oversea for investment and spend the rest of my life there with my family. "

"Dear Sir,It is with hope that I write to seek your help in the context below.I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria�s former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998. Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that is so traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I came in contact with your name and address in a website and would want to have good confidence in you as I view you to be a responsible personality. I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody( for safety) the sum of $50 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband�s property is under the authority of the family�s Lawyer (Attorney)Barrister MIKE AHAMBA(SAN).The investigative teams set up by government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the $50m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family friend without delay, for security reasons. All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized. This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your goodself with 10% of the total deposit when you finally the deposit box from the security firm and lodged in your account. They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me,you can write me through my e-mail, please reply direct to this email address; dr_mrsabacha@sify.com  for obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you keep all our communication very secret. Donot mention my family""s name or disclose the transaction to anybody.If you are not interested in assisting me, still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me.Best Regards,"
"Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'specialrelationship' sinks to new lowGordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obamaduring his trip to the United States as the fall-out from the release ofthe Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left ""the special relationship""at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years.By Andrew Porter Political Editor in New YorkPublished: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policychange in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders said diplomatic sources.But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearingon his own with Mr Obama had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New Yorkkitchen.The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest pointsince John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton.It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama despite thePresident hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan China and Russia. Downing Street claimed thatthis was not unusual.However a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown hadbeen a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister.""It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone"" the source said.""There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.""The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy onsupplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week.As a result it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference according to a seniorsource. However the meeting never happened.The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan and would""spend all day Friday together."" However Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of worldleaders.The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi appears to have been behind thenew chill in relations between Washington and London.Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month.Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger.Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive.Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday familiesof victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader Col Muammar Gaddafi madespeeches.Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informaldiscussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The15-minute ""walk and chat"" took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building inManhattan.No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate ""bilateral""meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meetingwith Mr Obama.In a speech to the United Nations Mr Obama said the world must ""move in a new direction"" and ""embrace20anew era of engagement"". That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis onrelations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poorrelationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair who enjoyed closefriendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush.John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton however because of claims that Mr Major hadtried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton'sstudent past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied.Mr Brown whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for96 minutes faced attacks on several fronts yesterday.Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing travelled toNew York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead ofjustice for victims families.The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in orderto safeguard talks on its nuclear programme.Shirin Ebadi Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner said the West cared more about its own securit y thanhuman rights.Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guestspaid $1000 to attend the function attended by among others Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono."

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek family or relatives but proved to no avail.

"Dear Friend,As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is BATES ALAN a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.God be with you. BATES ALAN"

"Since we got this information about his death and on furtherinvestigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered thatMr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or relations inallhis official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperworkin my Bank.

"sbwhoeopMonday November 2 2009 6:23 PMHFYI: When you have a chance re: what Wm. Hague told you relevant undercurrent toEU debate. SidFrsOrn The TimesNovember 3 2009I suggest a night at the theatre Mr CameronA sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should beashamedDavid AaronovitchOn Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. Theplay was Our Class by the Polish playwright Tadeusz Slobodzianek.In a series of short ""chapters"" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.Like the village the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941 as the Germans replaced the Russians as theoccupiers almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to themassacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.Though the village is not named in the play it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10 1941. AsPoland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002 on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around thetown singing songs and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where one by one they were killed with knives axesand cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barnand locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from twokilometres away; no one survived.In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans butlocal Poles as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski then the Polish President apologised to the dead Jewsand their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne ""in my own name and in the name of those Poles whose conscience isshattered by that crime"".History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski who leads the Tory-backedgroup in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of21000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a bigpart of their political appeal.But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski the MEP for the Jedwabne area did not support the 2001 apology. Heopposed it vigorously associating himself with the ""Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne"". Among itsleading members were the local priest Edward Orlowski who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending theceremony at which the President apologised — said: ""These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsibleso why should we apologiSe?""Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper Our Poland themurders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts and that he would only apologise if someone ""from theJewish side"" apologised for how ""the Jews"" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month MrKaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. ""If you are asking the Polish nation to apologisefor the crime made in Jedwabne"" he said ""you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewishcommunists did in Eastern Poland.""It is this argument that so incenses me•as it would anyone I think who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collectiveJewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.Mr Kaminski denied the apology denied the need for it equated the massacre to ""Jewish actions"" and allied himself withthose who denied the massacre altogether fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns ofmassacre denial: ""it never happened it happened but was justified they did it to themselves they did it to us."" MrKaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the lastfew weeks I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: ""Ishould apologise?""But more than that I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreignsecretary descended from Polish Jews should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician whovehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron hasgot right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.Now Tory columnists bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collectiveguilt and to attacking non-existent ""smears"" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.Why?It is true as embattled Conservatives have argued that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whosehistory is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping the EPP and in the socialist group. Butthese personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP forexample is the ruling free-market non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that MrCameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping the European Conservatives and Reformists by contrastis all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun bar one organisation — the BritishConservatives.So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really and that MrKaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised hisEurophobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the ""federalist"" EPP and that the logicaloutcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to thinkthrough the consequences of his own lightly given promises or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sectsthe Hannanites the Cashists and the Redwoodians?This is the kind of advice I loathe but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class Mr C. This is one hole you don't want tokeep digging."
He is clear and will be confirmed. Thank you and sorry for the fire drill.

It is because ofthe perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kinand the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairmanand members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangementfor the funds to be declared ""UNCLAIMED"" and will be lost to the FederalGovernment or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms andAmmunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa.

DeclanThanks for your email. Of course it's not personal. But I do think it'swrong.When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treatedNorthern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governmentsto adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the WhiteHouse I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congressand in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when weheld the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast thedinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those inrespective Governments.In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK that didn't mean Iinvited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform but theShadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a pointof not only saying we were bi-partisan but acted accordingly.Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with yourSecretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through anEconomic Conference I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have beeninvited to attend the Conference in any capacity.That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMirationfor Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the WhiteHouse as a Senator as a candidate and now as Secretary we could neverhave made the progress we did. You will know that at the time I was alwaysdisappointed that her contribution to the peace process and politicalprocess was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and theirspokesmen when they were in Opposition.The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next week'sConference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen onwhich to determine his priorities. You would not expect me to comment on hisdecision.However I don't have to rehearse with you that successful long-term> Best> DeclanForwarded Message

"America's Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others?Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairsand separately to members of the Norwegian Institute of International AffairsAmbassador Chas W. Freeman Jr. (USFS Ret.)1 September 2010 Oslo NorwayYou have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East with an emphasis on the prospects forpeace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs especially SaudiArabia to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis andPalestinian Arabs to reach consequential positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace not anotherdeceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive so-called ""peace process."" And if that one step forward in Oslo in1993 was followed by several steps backwards there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.There can be no doubt about the importance of today's topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbsthe world's conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of Europeancolonialism. In the post-colonial era tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became bydegrees the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. Itstimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War theinteraction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It isincreasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.For better or ill my own country the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in thiscontest. American policies more than those of any other external actor have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds inthe Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the MiddleEast thus affect much more than that region.Yet as I will argue the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involveparties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel's behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regionalsupport for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a ""peaceprocess"" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There arealternatives to tomorrow's diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And as Norway has shown there is a role forpowers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.Over thirty years ago at Camp David Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt's Anwar Sadathad opened. Twenty years ago the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinianleaders setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally othergovernments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied but American power remains far greater than that ofany other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.For more than four decades Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily andto sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application ofinternational law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning Americansupport has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with thePalestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have broughtsuccessive Israeli governments to question let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.Ironically Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a politicalframework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation pogroms ethniccleansing and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressiveconfinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.Despite this appalling record of failure the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestineremains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in theregion — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union having earlier laid the basis forconflict in the region have largely sat on their hands while ringing them content to let America take the lead. ChinaIndia and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself Iran haspostured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently Turkey remained aloof.On rare occasions as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israelwith action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to concludearrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But overall Arab governments have earned the contemptof the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part Arab leaders havetimorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them while obsequiously courting Americanprotection against Israel each other Iran and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects andcitizens.Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embodyrighteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites' failure to meet these standardsgenerates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governmentsassociated with it.The perpetrators of the September 11 2001 terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for Americancomplicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington's protectionof Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington's response to the attackincluded suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan andIraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. Thearmed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan Yemen Somalia and othercountries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They areechoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United StatesThe widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed ametastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world's 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as amenace to their faith their way of life their homelands and their personal security. American populists and Europeanxenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowersterrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoteddemagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recentillustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. Itrules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.President Obama's inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came intooffice committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the internationalmedia was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkishparliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkablyeloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injusticesin the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judiciousrecrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama's sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policychange anyone can detect let alone believe inIt is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration'sstewardship of so many aspects of my country's affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this twomonths from tomorrow on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land Iraq Afghanistan and adjacent areas isonly part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes inthe situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.Let me begin with the ""peace process"" a hardy perennial of America's diplomatic repertoire that the ObamaAdministration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War the appearance of an earnest and ""even-handed"" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. Itprovided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as tostand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and theArabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course therehasn't been an American-led ""peace process"" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a ""peaceprocess"" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the ""peaceprocess"" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.Even when there was no ""peace process"" the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible cover to theguileful beguilement for the press an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo and — last but farfrom least — lifetime employment for career ""peace processors."" The perpetual processing of peace without therequirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave likemagicians riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from theirhomes settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories and annexed a wideningswath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a ""peace process."" It'snot just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people's suffering. Playing ""peace process"" charadesjustifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupiedterritories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile for Americanleaders engagement in some sort of Middle East ""peace process"" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamicworlds as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews areimpatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary they are eager to believe in the willingness of thegovernment of Israel to trade land for it.Previous ""peace processes"" have exploited all these impulses. In practice however these diplomatic distractions haveserved to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achievingit. Behind all the blather the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history it has taken a year and a half ofrelentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks asthey first did here in Oslo seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washingtontomorrow will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed""peace processes"" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-prepared meeting at Camp David in 2000 it cost both heads of delegation Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat their politicalauthority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize PresidentObama's political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States not to address his agenda — stillless to address each other's agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual ""peace process"" are more fundamental.The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulatesthat: ""The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule but not as an independent and sovereignstate."" This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It hasno interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unboundby the applicable UN resolutions agreements from past peace talks the ""Roadmap"" or the premise of the ""two-statesolution.""The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But theauthority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States not on theirstanding in the occupied territories Gaza or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Itsauthority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retainspower by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States which prefer it to the government empoweredby the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas's constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides overa parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he his faction or hisadministration can now speak.So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating withthe mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened internationalcredibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU Russiaand the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who waspublicly humiliated by Israel's prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel'scontinuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the ""peace process"" has alwayssneered at deadlines even much much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a yearwas made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resultedfrom previous meetings over the decades beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience willrecall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if theinternational community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinianstate. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible toimpose. It cannot become a reality still less be sustained if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This realitydirects our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems theseabsences create.Obviously the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet theyhave nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements wereexplicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quicklyfinessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcileeither American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will berepresented in Washington only in tenuous theory not in fact.Other Arabs including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative Saudi Arabia will not be at the talkstomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latestinstallment of the ""peace process"" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate andalso a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level they result from the way theUnited States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definitionevidences. Then too they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis Arabs andAmericans.To begin with neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new ""peace process"" have officially acknowledged orresponded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state should Israelmake peace with the Palestinians. Instead the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offerignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians and gone on to levy new demands.In this connection making Arab recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" the central purpose of the ""peace process"" offendsArabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something wellbeyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs Americans now seemto be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel the means by which that state was established andthe manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion andaccept peace?Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of ahomeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction ofPalestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is askingthem to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly the Arabs see the demand that theyrecognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel's unilateralexpansion at Palestinian expense.The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concernsabout Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views U.S.peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures ofacceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out it has been met withincredulity. To most in the region it encapsulates the contrast between Washington's sympathy and solicitude for Israelisand its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasementof Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a ""peace process"" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts ofcarrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrouslyunpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element ofGeorge Mitchell's mandate for ""peace process"" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposedfollow-up to tomorrow's meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and otherArabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.As a last thought before turning to what must be done let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabichas two quite different words that are both translated as ""negotiation"" making a distinction that doesn't exist in eitherEnglish or Hebrew. One word ""musaawama"" refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place inbazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam eachother. Another ""mufaawadhat"" describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle thattake place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process ofmufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. Itcalled for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while Israel responded withintermittent somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms onwhich a grand gesture has been granted is not surprisingly seen as insultingly unresponsive.I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought but to make a point about diplomaticeffectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction one must understand how that partner understandsthings and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of thereasons we can't seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don't make much effort to understandhow others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum we Americans arelong on empathy and expertise about Israel and very very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essentialmilitarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We haveforgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.I am not myself an ""Arabist"" but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in theAmerican diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding andempathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we sawas in our interest. If we still have such people we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in ourMiddle East diplomacy.This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications forwhat must be done.In foreign affairs interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians indeedEuropeans in general share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind these interests include -but are of course not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the grossinjustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters as well asfriendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice including very likely a revival ofanti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end tothe Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.Arab states like Saudi Arabia also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determinationfor Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel's democracy as we are but they share an urgent interestin ending the radicalization of their own populations curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism and eliminating the tensionswith the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace asthey very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogueand the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.As the custodian of two of Islam's three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has longtranscended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of allsects and persuasions. This experience joined with Islamic piety reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption ofreligious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensurefreedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interestthat Jews Christians and Muslims share.There is in short far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than isgenerally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflectspathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow's meetingmay well demonstrate that the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding the United States is still unfit to manage theachievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so it is in the American interest as well as everyone else's thatothers become the path-breakers enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve but notexpecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.Here I think there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration washappy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect themfrom subversion and overthrow and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protectedfrom Israel's ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with mostAmericans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel securing freedom for the Palestinians and endingthe stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions topresent today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with theArabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for jointor parallel action on behalf of peace.Now to my suggestions presented in ascending order of difficulty from the least to the most controversial.First get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less giftedthan most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media havepublished some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of itscontents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the ArabLeague declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis as well as other members of theArab League would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperationwith them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-ArabMuslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn't be bad for Europe's relations withboth. By the way given the U.S. media's notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan awell-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.Second help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials whoare empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians soas to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peacepartner for Israel by bringing Fatah Hamas and other factions together. On each occasion Israel with U.S. support hasacted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unitygovernment to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strongdomestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under somecircumstances however it might welcome being put to this test.Third reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of lawinternationally. In the case of the Middle East however the Council's position at the apex of the international system hasserved to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have preventedthe application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions the Nuremberg precedents human rightsconventions and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced thecollective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupiedterritory administered collective punishment to a captive people assassinated their political leaders massacred civiliansbarred UN investigators defied mandatory Security Council resolutions and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behaviorusually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.If ethnic cleansing settlement activity and the like are not just ""unhelpful"" but illegal the international community shouldfind a way to say so even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -its vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles all exemptthemselves and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel bothas occupier and as regional military hegemon is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN GeneralAssembly cannot ""unite for peace"" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot member states should not shrinkfrom working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyondneed to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced there will be a betterchance for peace.Fourth set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UNSecurity Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conferenceoutside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement ina year one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conferencewould consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel's 1967borders or recognition of Israel's achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiringIsrael to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions boycott anddisinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face theconsequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of theinternational community. Admittedly any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomaticconfrontation with the United States as well as Israel despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow's talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefitimmensely from peace with the Palestinians.Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlementactivity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so it will not be local or regional but global in its reach. Israel'sactions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who aredetermined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin toalleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rageagainst injustice that incites terrorism.It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperationbetween Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been askedto set the stage for a discussion of this issue."

"                                                      I am Dr.Mrs. Owens Mary from Madrid,Spain. I am married to Engr.Owens jim, who worked as the financial director under United Nation Development Programmed for Africa for more than ten years before he died in the year 2004.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home, which the bible is against. When my husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$16.8Million United State Dollars (Sixteen Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars) with a London ALPHA SECURITY COMPANY in my name.Presently, this money is still with the security company; recently, my doctor told me that I would not last long due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my partial paralysis sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep this fund in the security company. I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, Widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.The bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don,t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the lord. Exodus 14 vs. 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regards because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don?t want them to know about this development but I can call you if you send your number across. With God all thing are possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the security company, that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment you will need to go and claim this fund. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through you're your life.Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply and remain blessed in the lord. You can contact my pastor Rev Marvin Smith, He is willing to assist us to conclude this transaction peacefully or Email sjackson_2006@yahoo.comYours in Lord,Dr.(Mrs.) Owens Mary.    ---------------------------------  Jiyo cricket on Yahoo!

"Cc: Cheryl Doug JustinThere is a context section at the bottom which is longer than I would like but Ithink it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what Ididn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clearlimitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentallyit rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organizationmanagement accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground we could quiteconceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea dysenterytyphoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my majortakeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)could do to drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in thenear and longer term. As is often said if I had more time - and less emotion - Iwould have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife withgrammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking mefirst - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.ThanksChelseaTakeaways are below with illustrative examples in a logical flow not order ofimportance. Bolded what I think most important.:- Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community tohelp them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of theUN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people Iencountered were frequently out of touch (e.g. would not have been offLogbase in days - or ever) anachronistic in their thinking at best andarrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g. one woman from the UN - UNDP Ithink - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their politicalrights"" - when they're asking for tents latrines soap food and not gettingthat....)In fact Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselvesin part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structureshave already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean MarieVincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a headof the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); awomen's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with asoap subcommittee) etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One ofthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head ofthe security committee and a few other settlement residents including 2women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100tshirts -though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the securityvolunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people particularlywomen would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3.They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally theywanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less importantthan the first two `asks'). IF that option were not feasible their second choicewas for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not theHaitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to helpthemselves and they wanted reliability and accountability from theirpartners.The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - arebeginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulatetheir needs willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tentsand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious toanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlementresidents themselvesThe Haitian government appears to have an emergent albeit stilllargely lacking in specifics plan of action (detailed below) for both thenear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (whilerebuilding over next -5 years)The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enoughor in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to aproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help' some ofwhich have helped (e.g. we met no one who was worried about watersupplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross OxfamIMO/IOM etc that have achieved that) some of which have hurt (e.g. thelargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1000 people or 40 for-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45ktoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and somewhich have not happened at all (e.g. the only settlements with lights atnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;settlement at the Petionville Golf Club for instance has some lights at nightwhile most sit in darkness)This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effectson the Haitian government including that it has now visibly distanceditself from the UN Cluster process (e.g. instead of going to a meeting a daythe Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government'scurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process wasimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how I was told meetingswere ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visibleconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOsby the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. Theformer feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like veryfew actor(s) reliably show upAgain the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelledaround in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlementsor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers ridingaround however in their vans humvees etc. Though on the point of trucks Iasked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port AuPrince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NOaccessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFPfor instance is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had much less howmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks andcars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove byUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universallyacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents byHaitian doctors and by INGO partners perhaps in part because of itsnarrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that itsreliable - i.e. it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and othercentral locationsThere is NO accountability in the UN system or internationalhumanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs) this is not new newsbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g. thereis no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when theywould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care ofthe latrines etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the BritishRed Cross should know better—at the least the British Red Crosssubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrinesThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally toput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into thesettlements or helped set standardized and differentiated wages forsettlement work. For instance the UN cash for work program should havealready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to cleanlatrines; 'guard' latrines including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be onsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZdrop times etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When wewere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - itappeared - on rubble cleaning.Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically theresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting towork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of thecamps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the IsraeliAgency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4settlements for at least the next month.The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which isprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy fruit vegetable andgrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erraticin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now moresystematic and reliable in its food delivery. However it had not yetstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised fornext week.In contrast to the UN there appears to be respect for the US Military onthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people seeguarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces giventheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now arecovered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.(Also not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitiandoctors I met said ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is alsogreat fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and totalorganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. TheUN community in contrast did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.On an unrelated note the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts isnotable particularly given the high death toll among priests nuns andseminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of thisis familiar.):The Office of Special Envoy - i.e. you Dad - needs authority over the UNand all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effectiveauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently thecollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I knowyou know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the groundotherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.However regardless of the attachment to clusters there needs to be asingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the groundorganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.latrines lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituentsettlements with full structures - e.g. finance procurement projectmanagement etc. understanding certain functional areas would be cross-cutting (e.g. pay for work)There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow fromthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrinestents and lights - and what is needed to support installment servicingmaintenance etc of each. In parallel a new logistics center/ warehousecoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person Italked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.A plan must be developed for the rainy season which is already on usparticularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questionslike where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access foodand water and latrines at a minimum from those spaces? Also could thoseplaces be multipurpose e.g. also schools and clinic tents/semi permanentstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?On pay for work UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate withrelevant INGO partners to start employing people at differential wages inthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistentwages until a 'market' could developThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of thesettlements at the minimumSpeaking of censuses the UN also needs a census of itself and its materialsin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.For example we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there werecollectively I would estimate more than a hundred trucks and buses justsitting between the two as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according tolocals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects anoutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if theyand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6 surelypreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? Atthe least their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au PrinceSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that havereceived significant attention and offers of assistance e.g. the generalhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors including Sarkozy havenow offered to rebuildHolistically all of the above should support the Haitian government bothactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to helpaugment and build local capacity and capabilities where feasibleThe UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partnerswhenever possible post emergency phase at the least. For example workwith local solar light producers buy from local t-shirt factories (if anysurvived outside Port Au Prince) mandate WFP first look to local producersetc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium termthat should accommodate a local dimensionRe: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there at a minimum its missionshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could workon the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care fornon-earthquake related cases.Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end I hope there is asuccession plan for its current tasks e.g. the hospital security that theHaitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ atleast Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea whatthe transfer plan isRe: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-experienced chaos on SundayRe: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinkingabout this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -but still unclear what the action plan isRe: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan but it is a plan and weshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust andactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of allRe: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholicgroups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessaryexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It wouldbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to workRe: status including mental health of workers there both Haitian andex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right nowFYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action as I understand it:o Near term/ for the next year■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are notin the lowest lying flood plans i.e. get tents and latrines inplace ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in orbeing brought ensure food supplies sufficient ensure securityand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for theyoungest children.■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worstgeographies for flooding or practical reasons/ otherreasons (e.g. the one currently with 4000 people on the primeminister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlementselsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGOShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too closeto one another■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the abovediscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to gowhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key servicesonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid howto ensure sufficient light in the camps clearly critical tosecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right specof tent is for any of the above - housing clinic evacuationschool and what could be multipurpose; plan for olderchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial schoolplan; how to best support / help create where neededsettlement governance; how to census on a semi-regular basiswho is in the settlements■ Over next 6-12 months:• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for familiesto return to and subsequently encourage them to doso; government estimates this will be —30% of allhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess i.e. noevidence base)• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-existing villages around Port Au Prince wherefeasible to enable the government to move peopleout of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move400-1000 families to each of these as neededo Longer-term:■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why peoplewould move back or what the government's post-rebuildvision looks like■ Build more robust health education etc systems than existedbefore the earthquake■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""ContextI spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners inHealth (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday Friday and Sundayafternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange in the Central Plateau regionSaturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Princewith: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitiangovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaisonLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needsassessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice tothe voiceless' i.e. the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voicesof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because ofCheryl and Paul) UNDP UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested inbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts i.e. outside the UN ambitincluding people from Royal Caribbean McKinsey and the people we were travelingwith including Wes Edens CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the personwho donated and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIHClinton Foundation University of Miami Medical Center and others are using tomove goods by air and sea via transfer to Haiti. Informally I talked with: people insettlements and settlement committee heads through a translator; local Haitiandoctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctorsnurses and US police officers I ran into on the street at dinner at their ad hocresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us ournights in Port Au Prince a member of the local elite and her ad hoc Israel volunteers(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation ie their USAIDas mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort both onand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivershead of PIH in Haiti and others we met or ran into along the way."

"THREE THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS  ONLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT}Attn:I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business having gone through your remarkable profile on the internet. Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such.At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties.My name is MR TONY HILL I work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance Of US$48,223,000. 00 (Forty eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand U.S dollar).On further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the  account and no other person knows about this account.I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy  foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Australia in particular. I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account , no  beneficiary and nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder  which I will provide to you if you are interested, therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. The difference in country of origins is not a hindrance to the success of this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer.

"FROM THE DESK OF MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE.,DIRECTOR/OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN,CONTRACT AWARDING COMMITTEE:EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT.BURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICA.Dear Friend,I am Mr Alexandre Biaise, the Chairman of EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT Awarding Committee (EUCCAC) in BURKINA FASO West Africa.I got your information in a business directory from the Burkina Faso Chamber of Commerce and industries, when I was searching for a reliable, honest and trust worthy person to entrust this business with.I was  simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the directory. After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues, they were very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual business relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000,000.00 (Thirty Six million United States Dollars only.) into your personal or company's bank account.This fund was a residue of the over  invoiced contract bills awarded by us for the supply of equipment,hard/soft wares, pharmaceuticals/medical items relating to constructing tool's, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and other administrative logistics etc for the Burkina Faso Projects.This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant loop holes sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC, I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the Organization.We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from  different countries. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of Burkina Faso.This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and spurious political nature of this sub-region.The original contractors have been duly paid by the Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Africa, Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa).Through our bankers - Societe Generale Banque. This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We intend to pay out this fund NOW as the  organization is winding up its activities and the coast has been achieved.Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working under this organization, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country.It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of the entire sum ascompensation, 60% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction.This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation. You should provide the followings;1, YOUR COMPANY'S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,2, Your TEL AND FAX NUMBERS. (if available)3, THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,4, ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL, FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS.5, ACCOUNT NUMBER.6, SWIFT CODE.7, THE COMPLETE MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.Upon the receipt of this information, the documents and approval with the  text will be sent to you for confirmation and then forwarded to the organization for ratification and subsequent payment.As with the case of all organized (sensitive) and conspired DEALS, we solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefully and lead a Honorable business life afterward.There are no risks involved regards in this business. I suggest you reply me back for more intimate and details discussions.Yours Faithfully.Mr. MR ALEXANDRE BIAISE._________________________________________________________________Don't just search.

" BUSINESS PROPOSALDear sir / Madam My name is DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA., a member of the Presidential Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year there was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities homeless.The contract was handled by a foreign firm but because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been completed and the original contractor has since been paid,but the contract balance of US$38 million,which resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my partners are planning to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount into your account. We are ready to share this money with you on the basis of participation. We also have plans to invest part of this money in any viable business in your country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement age. In any case, I received a reference of you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry =91Foreign Trade Division=92 as a reputable organ that can assist us on this transaction.

Ma'am — Jake tells me that you are tired of the Lamplighter story. I'm sorry I didn't know. But the Belfast people havecome up with a FANTASTIC story -- apparently as per your request they have tracked down the two kids who won thepeace essay contest in the 90s and they are doing great things -- one is a teacher one is a police officer. They are nowreaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it I am writing uptheir stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.Sorry for the Lamplighter redux; I'll let Lissa know it's off-limits for at least a few years.
"My name is Mr. Edward Taibu, the stepson of Mr. Terry Ford of Zimbabwe. It might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address; I got it from the net. Don't be worried because I am contacting you in good faith. During the crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. Terry was one of the best farmers in thecountry and knowing that he did not support the President political ideology, the president supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated all his investments. Before this unpleasant incident, my mother and Terry had already visited South Africa to deposit the sum of Fifteen Million, Five HundredThousand United States Dollars (US$15.5M) in the safe vault of a Security and financial company here in Johannesburg  South Africa. This action was taken because Terry felt the growing tension on the farm issue but I guess he never anticipated the tragedy that brought his brutal and sudden death. At the time of deposition, the real content was not disclosed to the security officials; instead, it was deposited as Family Valuables? Valued for the real content in the consignment. After the bloody incident, we all had to escape out of our country for the safety of our lives. We seek refuge in South Africa and we were permitted to reside here as Political Refugees under section (5.9). Because of our present and unpleasant status, my mother and I are seriously looking forward to having an overseas partner that will assist us with the convenient and legal transfer of the funds out of South Africa. If my proposition is considered, for assisting us to transfer this money to your country, we will offer you 25% of the total fund,75% will be for my family. We wish to invest a large portion of our share in your country under your supervision. For detailed information, you can contact me on my e-mail. I would appreciate confidentiality and honesty in our correspondence. Your immediate response will be highly welcomed. I wait to hear from you. Be with God. Best Wishes, Edward Taibufor family "

"Good day,    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting youconcerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under ourbanks management three years ago.I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one isinformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certainfacts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, thesubject matter; came to our bank to engage in business discussions withour private banking division. He informed us that he had a financialportfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have usturn over (invest) on his behalf.In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed tomake an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. Hedirected that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. Iinformed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to havethis done and in order not to circumvent due process.Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since theincidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds availableto the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure Ifollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the fundsdeposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialistprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals andblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertaketransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highlyprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed andwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money wasdeposited with the security firm.The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of hisarrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication wehad, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, andwe got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity ofthat particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internalinvestigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. Aperson who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack inCanne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify thebody and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed nonext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with usmeans no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under aname; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful; we�ve used ourprivate investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of theproblem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished withyour details as a possible relative of the deceased.What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I wantyou to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking worldwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. Theworld of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for thosethat occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You shouldhave begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.There is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, Ialone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no oneunless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of thisdeposit for as far as my Bank is concerned."
Apparently - will find out what.
Sorry - just seeing. I was told they were sent and received. Will check.

I hope you do understand my concern in this matter, if we do not =use this opportunity to claim this fund,since the deceased relatives cann=ot be traced, the management of the bank will declare the deceased's acco=unt dormant and revert the fund on Trading and Investment in the interest= of the bank.For your assistance, you will be compensated adequately with (40%) of the=m, total sum (55%) will be my own share while (5%) will be set aside to c=over any incidental expense made both at home and abroad prior to this tr=ansaction . If you are interested in assisting me with this matter,please= send to me urgently via my EMAIL thefollowingdetails below:*Full name, Company or Private Address*Telephone and Fax number(s).Upon receiving the above details from you, I will work out every document=s/proof representing you as the deceased BONA-FIDE distant relative and w=hen this is done, you will be contacted by the bankfor the release and co=llection of this fund, which will be within one week of my receiving the =above details from you.I will meet with you in your country for disbursem=ent after the fund might have been released to you and also to discuss in=vestment potentials as I will like to invest in your country with your as=sistance.Be assured that this transaction is 100% risk free, as I have ta=ken all necessary modalities to enable a hitch free transaction.Kindly en=sure to treat this matter in strict privacy (HighlyConfidential).Yours sincerely,Barrister Jonathan Micheal- JOENATHAN MICHEAL"

"FROM; MARK ANDERSONTEL 27- 83-89-96-388ATTN; C.E.O/MDYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MARK ANDERSON the first son of MICHEAL ANDERSON who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe.I got your contact from world online in e-mail data services of south africa chamber of commerce and industry in my search for reliable individual or company to assist me in this transfer business transaction.Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$25Million(twenty five million United States Dollars),in one the private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.This money was deposited in a box as germ stones to avoid much demurrage from Security Company.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and established of new farm in Swaziland.This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduce a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks farmers.And  this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.  In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was one of the victim.It is against this background that, I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father?s money to foreign account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the teritorial zone South Africa. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddle with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar political history. Moreover, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment for an asylum seeker.As a businessman, who I have to entrust my future and of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free.  If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg ? South Africa, so that you can open a non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas.  This money I intend to use for investment.I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.  Whichever the options you want, feel free to notify me I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing togive you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with the above E-mail while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrect required in this transaction.Yours Faithfully,MARK ANDERSON_________________________________________________________________Make each Search mission a success with MSN Toolbar! http://toolbar.msn.co.za?DI=1054&XAPID=2083"

"Dear Friend, I know this mail may come as a surprise to you, since we do not know ourselves or have any previous contact before now, my purpose of writing you is this. We believe that you would be in a position to help us in our bid to transfer the sum of twenty-seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($27.5m) into a foreign account. We are members of a special committee for budget and planning of the ministry of petroleum, this committee is principally concerned with contract appraisals and approvals in order of priorities as regards capital project of the federal government. With our positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of twenty-seven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ($27.5m). The present government in my country are seeking the support of foreign governments, so they gave directive to all federal parastatals to compile and settle all foreign contractors being owned for contract that has been executed, so our plan is to include the name that you will provide us, as one of the contractors being owed in my corporation, the Nigerian national petroleum corporation (NNPC). What we need from you is (1) a company name or a name of which to use as the company that did execute the contract (2) an account even if empty into which the fund will be transferred, this is because our code of conduct prohibits government officials from operation or owning foreign account. It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with US$8.3million of the remitted funds; we will keep US$16.5million, while US$2.7million has been set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes. It may also interest you to know that two years ago similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. George Brooks of (BROGE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION) at number 135, East 57th street, 28th Floor, New York 10022 with telephone (212) 308-7788 and telex number 6731689, after the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 25% of the remitted fund (fifteen million united state dollars $15.000.000.) was duly transferred into his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York as we were told that Mr. Brooks was no longer on that address, while his telephone number had been re-allocated to somebody else, that was how we lost our money to Mr. Brooks. This time around we need a more reliable and trusted person or a reputed company to transact this project with hence this proposal to you, so if you can prove yourself to be trustworthy ready to partake in this project then we are prepare to do business with you. What we need from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share after the transfer of the fund ($27.5million) into your account. If this proposal satisfies you,we can advice you on modalities of the transaction, and note that all modalities has been worked out and once started will take less than two weeks with the absolute support of all concerned. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and totally safe now or after the fund transfer to your account. I will also like you to forward to me your telephone number for easy communication. Please treat as urgent and confidential as I look forward to your reply. Best Regards, >From Engr. moel Kobo AliN.N.P.C"

"Dear Sir/MadamCompliment of the day to you .I got your contact through a friend, who attended a programme in 2005,S.P.E.Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, in searching for a reliable andtrust worthy person to handle risk free transaction.He recommended you to me.=I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie =Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =December 29th2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creekmade a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued atTWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in mybranch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwardingaddress but got no reply.After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from hiscontract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made furtherinvestigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any nextof kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and theinterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. =No one will come forward to claim it.According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody appliesto claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you toassist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michaelcreek, so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into thehands of some corrupt officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your fullnames and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documentsand affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shallemploy the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of theWILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administrationin your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will thenfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneousexpenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessarypaperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Managerguarantees the successful execution of this transaction.Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding.Best Regards.Mr.Mustapha Momodu  --36c3cac6-f322-404a-9058-1e6db6ebf8a3--"

"Kindest attention,I am very sorry for the informal manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious.I am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President WilliamR. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia. I received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light.Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support. I quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is even more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003, Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim government. Bryant, 54 was by picked b! y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer approached him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here.

The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have ""Opted In"". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive �3 (�5/$5) from each of them, that's; �9,375 (3,125 x �3(�5/$5). So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position. "

"H: In case you haven't seen it this is the fully articulated view of the Netanyahu government and Likud about ""the crisis.""-ihe New Republic is a preferred cutlet for the highest level Likudineocon propaganda. ?Viichae! Oren a channel for IsraeliIntel was a frequent contributor in the past. On a lower level; so was Michael Ledeen when he was traffickingdisinformation. The New Republic was critical in undermining Carter when he pressed Begin Israeli intel used Ledeenand TNR to put out the stories on Billy Carter. But TNR is only one key being hit in the Wurlitzer. Here's one small butfrank thing: Axelrod should not be a foreign policy spokesman on any issue or area. He has badly exacerbated this one.Many people in the press feel he's out of his lane and resent being lectured by him on foreq..3n policy. Foreign Policymagazine website has run a piece on this reflecting widespread sentiment. (I've enclosed this article bellow the TNR onebelow.) I'd make Steinberg tell Donilon they need to rein in Axelrod. Axelrod has enough to do fixing the domestic messeshe's made. Let it come from Steinberg. He's unhappy anyway. Sidhttp://www.tnr.corniarticie/world/the-crisis?page=00EaPublished on The New RepublicWas Obama's confrontation with Israel premeditated'?Yossi Klein Halevi4. March 16 2010 17:13 pmJERUSALEM—Suddenly my city feels again like a war zone..Since the suicide bombings ended in 2005 life inJerusalem has been for the most part relatively calm. The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting fromconstruction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy again there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near thegates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch young men marching withgreen Islamist flags toward my neighborhood ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this city's ultimatenightmare.The return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage processin the eventual construction oft600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Suchannouncements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely respondedlet alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis the permanence of Ramat Shiomo and other Jewishneighborhoods in East Jerusalem has been a given. Ramat Shlomo located between the Jewish neighborhoods ofFrench Hill and Rarrot will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem accord ng to every peace plan. Unlike theSnail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the establishedJewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus.Why then the outbreak of violence now? Why Harness ""day of rage"" over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority's callto gather on the Temple Mount to ""save"" the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Whythe sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948 in the Old City's Jewish Quarterwhen dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident?The answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in EastJerusalem at the center of the peace process President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do noless.Astonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over thelast year. Though Oben-la's insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate he went a steptoo far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewishneighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government let alone one headed by the Likud could possibly agree to a freezethere. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was thatPalestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly.Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. ThoughPalestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank they now refused to sitdown with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama's demand for a building freezein Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.Finally after intensive efforts the administration produced the pathetic achievement of ""proximity talks""—settingPalestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same tablewith Israelis.That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was after ail an amateur. Buthe has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo andelsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—he's ensured that thePalestinians won't show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.Initially when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made Israelis shared Vice President Biden'shumiliation and were outraged at their government's incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahudeserved the administration's condemnation not because of what he did but because of what he didn't do: He failed toconvey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden's visit symptomatic of his chaotic style ofgoverning generally.But not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamirthe former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement ofthe creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. onthe Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That's why he included the Labor Party into his coalition andwhy he accepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud however reluctantly within themainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Bidenduring his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party which runs the interior ministrythat oversees building procedures. Shas which supports peace talks and territorial compromise is not a nationalist party.Its interest is providing housing for its constituents like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking internationalincidents is not its style.Finally the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is consideredby Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in theinterior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.In turning an incident into a crisis Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking a pretext to pick a fightwith Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama deliberately so.Ac.tcording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma'ariv senior Likud officials believe that Obama's goal is to topple theNetanyahu government by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given hisineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions the Israeli public isnot likely to be impressed. Indeed Israelis' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to anIsrael Radio poll on March 16 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis while 20 percentblame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) •In the last year the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even thoughthe Palestinian Authority media has for example been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews' historic rootsin Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after aterrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn't merit an administration rebuke.Obama's one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of ""open season"" against Israelinternationally. Indeed the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to theresumption of the peace process—as if it's Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.If the administration's main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem its mainstrategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office RehmEmanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama's first tent.instead a year later we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israelnegotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as ifIsraelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them.To insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden's plea to Israelis to consider awithdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offertwice in the last decade: first when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000 andthen more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas says Olmert neverreplied.The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine thereturn of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solutionfrom devolving into a bi-national one-state solution. Israel's insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace.To achieve eventual peace the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifaand Jaffa and confine their people's right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo theirclaim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people's right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possibledeal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority ofIsraelis—along with the political system—has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side the political system hasrejected it.In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return negotiations should not focus on a two-state solution but on more limited goals.There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has createdpanic within Fatah and the result is for the first time genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also the emergence ofSalem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad stilllacks a power base). Finally the West Bank economy is growing thanks in part to Israel's removal of dozens ofroadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.But by focusing on building in Jerusalem Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peaceprocess Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.The administration according to a report in the Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot is making an even more insidiousaccusation against Israel. During his visit wrote Yediot Aharanot Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies areendangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not theremark was made what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama's recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--lives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window Obama's political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning intoa third intifada over Jerusalem.Yossi Klein Ha/evils a senior fellow of the She/em Center in Jerusalem and a contributing editor of The New Republic.WM David Axelrod please be quiet pease?Posted By 4 '■ (I?

Wouldn't she have been the more appropriate spokesman.I've spent enought time inside the Beltway to be leery of the gossipy tidbits I collect when I'm down there.

The facts will be right. Meanwhile we're working to make it more of a semiautomatic.
"Dear friend,I want to solicit with you for assistance in regards to a financialtransaction.  I am the son of one of the foremost and rich black farmers inZimbabwe that was murdered for land dispute in my country. Before the deathof my father, he had given me the certificate of deposite he used to deposita large sum of money in one of the private security companies in Europe, asfamily valuables, when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe.This amountwas meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals forthe farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This landdispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new landreform,which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a fewblack farmers (my father included).This resulted in the gruesome killing ofrich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their propertiesby Mugabe's war veterans, under the  disguise of fighting for the interestof the country. It is against this background that I fled the country withmy family,to the United Kingdom where we are currently seeking asylum.I havebeen adviced to seek foreign assistance, as the United Kingdom law prohibitsasylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financialtransaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is yourtrustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help mewith investment opportunities. My family's survival depends on this moneyas we have virtually lost all our other assets.There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept a negotiablepercentage of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnershipfor the proper investment of the money in your country.We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.I await your reply through my confidential email media, while I implore youto maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch freetransaction.I shall furnish you with more details on request.Yours truly,"

"Dear Sir or Madam:We are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:I. Background:Shengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp. (http://www.sinopec.com), as well as neighboring oilfields as Dagang Oilfield, Central Plain Oilfield and Jiangsu Oilfield are potential market of ERW oil casing. It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. II. About usShengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Factory is one of sub-companies of Shengli Oilfield Co., Ltd, with total assets of 267 million yuan, net assets of 170 million yuan and 2462 staff. The factory mainly produces oilfield special equipment such as beam unit, Spiral-seam submerged-arc weldedsteel pipe, sucker rod, line pipe, casing, tubing, plastic compound pipe etc. It produces 200,000 tons of line pipes, 1 million meters of strengthened plastic compound pipes, 500 beam units, 2.5 million meters of sucker rods, 12,000 tons of PP gas pipes and 50,000 tons of oil tubings yearly, and has become important pipe base in Shandong and Shengli Oilfield. Its products have entering many areas as Shengli Oilfield, Daqing Oilfield, Liaohe Oilfield, Dagang Oilfield and so on. In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.The Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.III. Content of the projectIt is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter from��114 to ��339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.IV. Product specificationsFor Casing: grade of steel are J55 and N80, specification ranges from ��114 to ��339.7For delivery: grade of steel are X52��X60��X70, specification ranges from ��114 to ��339.7.V. Economic AnalysisThe total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.The break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.VI. Plans for cooperationWe have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:a. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35��b. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30��c. Dongying District State Assets Operation & Management Co., Ltd 5.70million yuan 10��d. Marubeni Engineering Technology Co., Ltd           14.25 million yuan   25��To meet our capital need for this project, we are now planned to increase our registered capital to 118.88 million yuan. Taking our added investment into consideration, we need another 34.68 million yuan to get the plan executed. So we are seeking a new joint venture partner who'd like to join this project and meet our capital requirement.We would like to exchange the information with the manufacturers and suppliers who are interested in this project and have discussion on raw material supply as well as jointly investing the factory establishment. And we hope we could have good cooperation in future.For additional information regarding this project, please feel free to contact us.Looking forward to your prompt reply.Sincerely yours, Tony LeungProject officer"

"FROM THE DESK OF Mr,KAREM AHMED.BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA.PHONE CONTACT  00226.78.89.77.34DEAR FRIEND,I know you may be surprise to recieve this e-mail ; I got your contact address from the internet while I was searching for my friend that has similar name with you.I am the manager of bill and exchange BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) at foreign remittance department.There is a business I would want you to champion for me, in my department I discovered an abandoned sum of ($31.500.000 U.S) thirty one million five hundred thousands US dollars)In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on 25TH JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passenger�s aboard. The name of the deceased man was(MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany)N.B. In other for you to believe me honestly, visit the web site to enable you know whether we can work together, below is the website.                    http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stmYou have to understand that I come crossed this huge amount of money when I was arranging the departmental customers file to submit to the bank management for the annual audit of the year.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after some years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to operate any  foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I don�t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill, I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.All modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once started will not take more than fourteen (14) working days, with your full support.This transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any precaution there after.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letterreply to thi box. at;Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully,Mr,KAREM AHMEDBill and exchange manager,BANK OF AFRICA_________________________________________________________________Personnalisez votre Messenger avec Live.com http://www.windowslive.fr/livecom/"

Can we put out the below?Draft S Statement on the HikersI was pleased to learn of the consular visit yesterday by the Swiss Ambassador in Iran to the three detained Americanhikers Shane Bauer Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd. But we are disturbed by the families' reports of their children'sphysical and emotional health. These three Americans -- innocent tourists in Iraq's Kurdistan region when they weredetained on July 31 2009 -- have been unjustly held for almost nine months without formal charges or access to legalrepresentation. We ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to release these three Americans and allow them to go home and bereunited with their families.###
We are awaiting formal confirmation from our team. We are drafting a statement while we wait.
Agree about Why did leave? B6

"Dear Sir My name is LOI C. ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located in the South East Asia. My husband was recently impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. The present government is forcing my husband out of manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. before my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my foreign business partner owned it. I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. When I receive your positive response I will let you know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the money which is very important. For now, all our communication is by e-mail because my line are right now connected to the Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I will ask my son to contact you to give you more details , after i have received a responce from you. Thank you and God bless you and family. MRS LOI C. ESTRADA"

"My dearest,With due regard and respect, I am emailing you although its wrong to seeksuch assistance without prior knowledge of the person involved.  I hope Iam not mistaking but I also believe that at the end of the day, you willnever betray I and my family on this project.I am Princess Fayad W. Bolkiah, the wife of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, formerFinance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the GulfIsland. I did not mean to amplify my extended royal family history, whichhas already been disseminated by the international media during thecontroversial dispute that erupted between my husband and his stepbrother=,the sultan of Brunei; His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadinWaddaulah.As you may know from the international media, the sultan; His MajestySultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin Waddaulah had accused my husband offinancial mismanagement and impropriety of US$76.8 million dollars. Thiswas as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my husband'scompany Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei InvestmentCompany to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office. However myhusband is in jail now, his bank accounts and private properties includin=ga crude oil export refinery have been confiscated by the sultanate.Furthermore, during this unfortunate period I was advised to evacuate myimmediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution fromthe sultan and his security operatives, but luck ran against me on myattempt to escape. The Sultan now keeps me under house arrest and I haveno access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which Iam sending you this mail.Before my In-castration, I was able to dispatch the sum of FourteenMillion United States Dollars (US$14M) in cash under special arrangementinto the custody of a Private security and Trustee company for safekeeping abroad. This action was on the orders of my husband to me toenable us start a new life. The money was packaged carefully into two andkept in trunks. Hence I seek your good assistance to retrieve this moneyand further invest into profitable investment in your country tofacilitate future survival for my family abroad. I have decided to offer20% of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation.Please I count on your absolute confidentiality, transparency and trustwhile looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion ofthis business transaction.Many Thanks & May Allah blessing remain with you, Amen.I remain yours sincerelyPrincess Fayad .W.

But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone-deafness by Jones about his roleand responsibilities his relationship with the President and his relationship with younger dedicatedhardworking and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff members thatstayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work.I speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They are hardworking racing as fast asthey can to manage the many many many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneouslypursue.James Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures anddecision-making processes. On the other hand his critics see him as a plodding slow-moving out of touchretired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving into. His°critics think that he's just too unable to animate nimble high flex policy decision making products for a WhiteHouse on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with.Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy Tom Donilon ismanaging his brief Many see him picking up the load that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon isdeeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfoliothe China economic and security portfolio and he has -- according to reports -- supported and helped cultivaterelationship building between State DoD the NSC and other parts of the national security bureaucracy.Some tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the ""whack-a-mole"" crisis reaction styleof decision-making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in nationalsecurity affairs. Tom Donilon according to reports wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day today management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response.Jones in contrast has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is involved in those decisions whatthe structure of decision-making should be and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. Helooks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve according to Jim Jones thePresident's effectiveness and chances of success at a macro level.Jones' self-determined task is not high profile mostly structural and has not won him many admirers forleadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he departs his role this challenge of dealing with the growingcomplexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision-makingprocess will require the attention of someone serious.So whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital.But what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit.Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones' management style -- but they verywell could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to havemore than their fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process.Jones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making -- quite evident when it comes toMiddle East policy -- and the hawkisheocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administration'sforeign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones.I don't know if he'll survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need to know that those ""longer knives"" onthe whole do not have pure motives.-- Steve Clemons directs the foreign policy programs at the New America Foundation and publishes the popularpolitical blog The Washington NoteShop Dell's full line of Laptops now starting at $349!"

"US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failedUlster police dealYes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast nextmonthDavid Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be ""emboldened""to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if hefails to persuade the Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP a bipartisan group of USCongress members have demanded Cameron must ""aggressively"" encourage his partners to endorse the deal ina vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday.""At this defining moment in the peace process it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voiceabout their shared future"" the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron.Without a unanimous vote they said the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message tothe people they represent and to the world.""Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents willcontinue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge ofbringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there ispolitical stability.""The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to theGuardian before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the DemocraticUnionists.A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the Britishgovernment has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement.The congressmen and women whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state HillaryClinton wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubtsabout endorsing the deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed or not bothered to warnthe UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal.A Tory source said: ""David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing andcriminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details arefor the parties in the executive working as a four-party coalition to decide. We hope that between now andTuesday any outstanding issues can be solved.""The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was thelargest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalistand Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly.Sir Reg Empey the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement will meet hisparty's executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote.The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assemblymembers account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote fromthe UUP seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it would destabilise many members ofthe DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers."

"(cheu_ngpui4010@yahoo.com.hk)Dear Friend,Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director ofoperations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured businesssuggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was withthe Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed depositfor 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million FiveHundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturityseveral notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification was sent and still no responsecame from him. We later find out that the Majorand his family had beenkilled during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadibasem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers includingthe paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the lasttime he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit inmy bank.So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United StateDollar is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward toclaim it.What bothers me most is that according to the laws of mycountry at the expiration 4 years the funds will revert to theownership of  the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim thefunds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you asa foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that youwill be able to receive his funds.WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that weshall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that willprepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kinto Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage isfor you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that theattorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next ofkin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf andsecure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor forthe move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt alegalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessarydocuments. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all mattersconcerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account weshall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you . Should you beinterested please send me your full names and current residentialaddress and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address below(cheu_ngpui4010@yahoo.com.hk)And finally after that i shall provide you with more details of thisoperation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Cheung Pui."

"Don't think oscar was able to get this to you before you left. Its a few ny notes from chris falvo before the school event:TO: Secretary ClintonFROM: Chris FalvoDATE: September 8 2009RE: NY Local IssuesSchools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday September 9th. As a result you will be visiting a charter school thatopened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew who took over as President of the UFT whenRandi left for AFT will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you havemet numerous times Dick Riley and Bridget Rein will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary lastmonth.H1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC's plans to handle this health concern and a significantportion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason isthat they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed soinstead they are asking sick kids to stay home.And if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day a doctor will visit to monitor the situation.Every student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available.Primary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor the primary races that have beenclosely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric GioiaCouncilmember Bill DeBlasio former Public Advocate Mark Green and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running forComptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui Melinda Katz David Yassky and David Weprin.Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways andMeans Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House Rangel failedto disclose at least $800000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into hisfailure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developerwho leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising andwhether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of NewYork. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post andBuffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday Rangelsaid that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. ""Some Americans have notgotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering 'How did this happen?' ""Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.""Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live ashuman beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing"" he said. Afterthe forum Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. ""What I'm saying is if you watch the town-hallmeetings people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry withtheir member of Congress period"" he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Patersonclaimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is raciallydriven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments.120Little League World Series - Staten Island's little league team the South Shore Nationals made it to the Little LeagueWorld Series but they lost the title two weeks ago with a 4-1 loss to the Southwest Regional Champs McAllister ParkAmerican from San Antonio.9/11 - Jay Winuk founder of the My Good Deed organization and brother of 9/11 victim Glenn Winuk notified us thatDOJ has finally award his brother the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor.

"ACCOUNT.My name is Mr.Bernard Martin and I work in the International Operation Department in a Bank here in London. I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN.

Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigne r because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder, Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) before his last resignation from office on October 20, 2004.

I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. Let me hear from you urgently through this Email<bernardmartin01@rediffmail.com>Best Regards Mr.Bernard Martin."
Did you get what you need? Is there anything else that might be helpful to you?
"Dear Sir,I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistanceto each other likewise developing a cordial business relationship. As I am interested in your kind of business and wishing to invest in your country.I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian military Head of State. General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 still in office duetoa protracted illness.I believe you must be aware of the recent face-off between my family and the present Civilian Government of President Olusegun Obasanjo who wants all my Late husbands foreign bank accounts and assets confiscated because of the monetary excesses of my late husbandsMilitary regime.Currently, within my reach is the sum of twenty-three Million seven Hundred thousand United States Dollars (US$ 23,700,000.00) cash, which I intend touse for investment purposes especially in your country. This huge sum of money came as result of a payback contractdeal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country's Multibillion Dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant/complex. The Russian partners had sincereturned my husband's share of US$23.7Million after his death and lodged it with a security firm.Right now the new Civilian Government have revoked all our licenses thatallows us to own financial and oil companies and has frozen some of my latehusbands bank account in Switzerland and America.In view of these I acted very fast to withdraw this US$23.7M from thesecurity company's vault well preserved and packaged in {1}trunk box and lodged in a private security firm OVERSEAS as Family Deposits (FD) No record everexisted concerning the moneyneither is the money traceable by the Government because there is nodocuments showing that we received the money from the Russians.However, due to the current situation in the country concerning the present civilian Government hostile attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of the money within the country. Thus I seek your assistance in moving this family Deposits (FD) into your account for safekeeping pending myarrival in your country for investment purposes.On your consent, I shall provide you with a POWER OF ATTORNEY to collectthis deposit with the security company OVERSEAS on our behalf. Bearing in mindthat your assistance is needed in this regards, I propose a commission of 20% (TWENTY PERCENT) of thetotal sum to you for the expected services and 10% for local andinternational expenses if any.Your urgent response is highly needed so as to start further contact .I therefore mandate Barrister GREG ADO who is our family Attorney to deal with you through out this transaction on my behalf.May I at this point, emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this business demands whatever your decision and hope you will not betray thetrust and confidence which I repose in you.Please don't forget to indicate your convenient phone and fax number wherewe can always contact you.However, you may need to give me sufficient assurance that you will not siton this fund when it is finally remitted into your account. Please direct your reply of this mail to my family attorney,GREG ADO at gregado@rxpost.net anddiscuss withhim towards effective completion of this transaction.I believe I can trust you and I am willing to accept from you any useful and profitable investment proposal advice in your country. or reply me if my proposal interest you through my alternative email address:mcabacha@gawab.coms.Remain blessed.Best wishes,Mrs. Maryam Abacha.----------------------------------------------------------------Ce service de mailing vous est offert par http://www.freesurf.fr.FreeSurf, votre acces ADSL a partir de 29 euros/moishttp://www.freesurf.fr/adsl/"

Obama in contrast had a 51 percentapproval and a 45 percent disapproval rating.The Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and hasnot been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administration's agendaincluding the health care fight the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts. And she has not beensubjected to nearly the same media and partisan scrutiny as the president. Obama meanwhile hasbeen on national television on a daily basis tackling a wide range of difficult issues.The poll was conducted by the nonpartisan Clarus Research Group from December 7th to the 12thand it asked for opinions of the top Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Its finding onObama and Clinton mirrors that of earlier polls — in October for example a Gallup poll found thatClinton had become more popular than the president.Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason for Clinton's high poll numbers is her high approvalamong Republicans — numbers he said position her well to run for president again in the future if shechooses. Clinton had 96 percent approval among Democrats a healthy 57 percent approval amongRepublicans and 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama was nearly as popular amongDemocrats — 93 percent — but his numbers among Republicans and Independents fell offdramatically at 19 percent and 33 percent respectively.Clinton's Republican numbers are striking given how intensely disliked she has been in the pastamong GOP voters. In fact part of Obama's appeal to Democratic primary voters in 2008 was that hewas more likely to be able to bridge the partisan divide than Clinton who was by then a well-knownfigure dating to her time as first lady in the 1990s.""Republicans may see her as being more hawkish than other Democrats on foreign policy issues""said Faucheux. ""It may be a way for them to bolster that position within the administration."" Askedabout any future Clinton presidential bid he said ""She's in good shape now.""The next highest-rated cabinet secretary in the survey was Defense Secretary Robert Gates whonotched a 69 percent overall approval rate with a 78 percent approval among Democrats and 63percent among both Republicans and independents.""Both Clinton and Gates did well across the partisan board"" said Faucheux. ""Everybody else did wellamong Democrats but fell off among Republicans.""Another trend spotted by the pollsters: Approval ratings inside the Beltway were higher than in therest of the country. ""These results show that the 'Beltway echo chamber' does not reflect the rest ofthe country even among news watchers"" said Faucheux.Among White House staffers and advisors Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — who is often seen ontelevision — had the highest overall rating at 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers had thelowest approval at 25 percent.Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — who are both closely associated with theeconomy — both posted higher disapproval numbers than approval. Summers' disapproval rating was41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating was 45 percent one point higher than his approval rating.The poll also found that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel who is often viewed as havingsharp partisan elbows scored much higher among Democrats at 72 percent than Republicans at 13percent.Among other major administration officials Vice President Joe Biden had a 50 percent approval and41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebeliusboth posted 41 percent approval and 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrodscored 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval; and National Security Adviser James Joneshad a 30 percent approval and 23 percent disapproval rating.Nora ToivOffice of the Secretary202-647-8633"

"  Dear Sir/Madam, I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland. I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field). All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased. The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharj�s property for her and her son. You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing you as the only beneficiary. The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not permanently resident in Switzerland. For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are concerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child. If you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will proceed. I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at www.royaltrust.com. We await your timely response. Best Regards DR PETER CLAPTON"

"Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to RealityBy BARRY MEIERThe likelihood that patients in the United States may some day receive heart defibrillators that can operate withoutelectrical wires connected to their hearts has moved a step closer according to a study published Wednesday.The development of the new type of defibrillator has been long pursued by a researcher Dr. Gust H. Bardy at the SeattleInstitute for Cardiac Research in Seattle. And in the study in The New England Journal of Medicine Dr. Bardy and otherresearchers reported that initial trials of such a device in patients were successful.Defibrillators fire an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially fatal heart rhythm and restore normal beating. For a unit tofunction a surgeon must thread an electrical sensing wire through a blood vessel into a patient's heart. The wires poserisks because they can on rare occasion puncture the heart during implantation or fracture while in place.The new version delivers the electrical jolt by means of a sensor implanted under the skin near the chest bone. A powerunit is placed under the skin on the side of the chest.The new device is already for sale in some European countries but Dr. Bardy and others cautioned that full-scale long-term trials were still needed to prove the implant's worth to the Food and Drug Administration. Even if successful theunit could not be used by all patients who needed a defibrillator but several researchers said they were excited by the newstudy nonetheless.Dr. Douglas P. Zipes a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis said the new device couldsomeday displace existing models used in many patients Every month about 10000 patients in this country get adefibrillator either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out.In recent years the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has beenprone to fracturing. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Alsoscar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult ordangerous.Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injurieswere a factor in his interest in developing the new device.""You are looking at a therapy that can avert we hope complications and be as effective"" he said.In the study published Wednesday Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successfulinitial trials including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients.The device is being developed by Cameron Health a small company in San Clemente Calif. that was co-founded by Dr.Bardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago the defibrillator he helped design has gonethrough several iterations.The device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients particularly those who require units that alsoinclude a pacemaker which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These arelargely patients at risk because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases for a type of erratic cardiac rhythmthat can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator.However he said it could help reduce health care costs because implanting it is much simpler.Before the device can be sold here Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to theF.D.A.. Dr.Bardy said a larger study of the device has just begun in this country and overseas and that it will most likely take a year ormore to assemble data from it for the agency's review."

But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file! before my husband in the impeachment trial; 1. Gov.

"jomutambara@fsmail.net.Websites:http://www.absa.co.zaDear Friend,  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Jonathan Mutambara, In charge of Credit and Foreign bills of my Bank, AMALGAMATED BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA (ABSA).   I  have an obscured business suggestion for you. One of our accounts with a holding balance of Money Valued $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Dollars) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past six years.     >From my investigations and confirmations, the owner  of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a citizen of Germany who perished in a plane crash [Concorde Air Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard on 31 July2000. And for your perusal you can view this web site:http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm and since then nobody has done anything as  regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the account nor the funds.Also Information from the National Immigration stated  that he was also single on entry into South Africa.  I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and we agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brows on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin with informations which will be made available to you. This transaction is totally risk and trouble free as  the fund is legitimate and does not originate from  drugs, money laundering, terrorism or any other illegal act.    The sharing of the fund between us, is as follows; 40% of the total sum will go to you for your effort and commitment to the success of this transaction. 60% for me and my colleague's.  Forward your reply to jomutambara@fsmail.net   Best Regards, "

I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR  PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN  NIGERIA.   I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS  A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE  THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF  US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND  LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING  DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING  FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16  1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE  REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM  KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED  TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS  THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER.

I LOST MY  WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING  THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.   THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE  AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH  HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE  SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO  FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES.  I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE  SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW  THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH  KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.   I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY  ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES.  THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM  KNOWING THE CONTENT.

"PRIVATEDear sir/Madam,I am Ben Maluleke, a Native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.

This amount (US$27.1m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$27.1 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured tel/fax number whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matterbecause we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business."
I can do it before noon tomorrow or on Sunday.

"You asked about this. It was Walter Isaacson.New BBG chief wants more money to combat ""enemies"" such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin TuesdayOctober 5 2010 - 4:43 PMThe Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson and the former CNN and Timemagazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's""enemies"" which he identifies as Iran Venezuela Russia and China.The BBG which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America Radio FreeEurope and Radio Free Asia funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world but at thesame time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting.Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress mustallow the U.S. government to do the same.""We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies"" he said. ""You've got Russia Today Iran's Press TVVenezuela's TeleSUR and of course China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel withcorrespondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- we've to go to Capitol Hillwith that number -- to expand their overseas media operations.""Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that Chinaand Iran were the prime targets.""China Iran and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies and Beijing has deployedarmies of cyber militias to go after their country's cyber dissidents"" he said. ""The BBG is at the forefront of combatingthis. Through constant innovation and technical evolution our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway foraudiences in China and Iran.""""We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom"" Isaacson said. ""Wherever there is a firewall it's our dutyto storm it to denounce it and to circumvent it.""Isaacson was speaking at last week's 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe which he credited ascontributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBG's outlets will stick to reporting the news objectivelyeven if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration.""It's sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition it'stasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all covering the news with the highest journalisticstandards and secondly being a part of America's public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to theworld"" Isaacson said.""Let me say to you my fellow journalists that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missionsour mission of being credible journalists because in fact it's the only way to carry out the second mission. You can't doit unless you're credible and telling the truth and in the end the truth is on our side.""Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means especially in light of reports that the Obama administrationsought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections Isaacson promised he wouldn'thesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations.He said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent ofthe time -- as for the other 10 percent a choice must be made.""I feel it's the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism just as you would in theprivate sector"" Isaacson said. ""We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so that will probably help furtherthe foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it's ever a real conflict our goal one is to protect our credibility."""

MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying in SouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it.

"Dear Sir.  May I seek your indulgence to introduce my humble  self. I am Kokor Mobutu, the son of the late Zaire Republic President, Mobutu Sese Seko. Before the death of my father, he kept in my custody the sum of USD 30 Million ( Thirty million United States Dollars ) this money emanated from the sales of diamonds he made when he was still on the throne.  My father lodged this money in a security company outside our country for security reasons and because of the political instability in my country.   My Father introduced me to the security company       shortly before his death. He however deposited this money without any name rather, with coded numbers which is in my possession. With my father dead, my life was at great risk, I therefore had to leave my country under cover to Spain.  Now, I have decided to invest this money in a suitable and conducive environment. At this point, I now seek your assistance to transfer this money to your bank account for proper use. 20% of the total money will be yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure we might incur in the process while the balance will be for me.  On the receipt of your positive response to assist me on this project, all information related to the project will be made available to you on request. This business is 100% risk free as long as the confidentiality the business needs is observed. For this business to take off, your bank particulars where this fund will be paid into is required.

"sbwhoeopMonday August 23 2010 10:06 AMH: Yes there is a vast right wing conspiracy. SidB6A must read piece that looks at the Koch brothers control and funding of the tea party and right wing.http://www.nowyorkenconlirep2rtin08130/100830fa fpct maysl2pitatIbie=true#IxzzoxQuvTcbTA REPORTER AT 1.ARGECOVERT OPERATIONSThe billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.by Jane Mayetmo(.s..David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred milliondollars to right-wing causes.On May 17th a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall jovial-looking billionaire tOok thestage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre and David H. Koch was being celebrated for hisgenerosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming seasonand had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs Blaine Trumpin a peach-colored gown and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg in emerald green. Kennedy's mother Jacqueline KennedyOnassis had been a patron of the ballet and coincidentally the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch hadbought in 1995 and then sold eleven years later for thirty-two million dollars having found it too small.The gala marked the social ascent of Koch who at the age of seventy has become one of the city's most prominentphilanthropists. In 2008 he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre buildingwhich now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History whose dinosaur wing isnamed for him. This spring after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art Kochpledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum perhaps the most coveted social prize inthe city and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center where after he donated more than forty milliondollars an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair Michelle Obama. Her officesaid that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it mighthave created an awkward tableau. In Washington Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealthattacks on the federal government and on the Obama Administration in particular.With his brother Charles who is seventy-four David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries a conglomerateheadquartered in Wichita. Kansas whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company hasgrown spectacularly since their father Fred died in 1967 and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries inAlaska Texas and Minnesota and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towelsDixie. cups Georgia-Pacific lumber Staimnaster carpet and Lycra among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largestprivate company in the country after Cargill and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who yearsago bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars isexceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes minimal social servicesfor the needy and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with thebrothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political EconomyResearch Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a reportidentifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate science denial."" The report showed that from 2005 to 2008 the Kochs vastlyoutdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change unclerwriting'a hugenetwork of foundations think tanks and political front groups. Indeed the brothers have funded opposition campaigns againstso many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that in political circlestheir ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.In a statement Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report ""distorts the environmental record of our companies."" And. .David Koch in a recent admiring article about him in New York protested that the ""radical press"" had turned his family into""whipping boys"" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis the founder of the Center forPublic Integrity a nonpartisan watchdog group said ""The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who hasspent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking politicalmanipulation and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate and I've never seen anything like it. They are theStandard Oil of our times.""few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization thatDavid Koch started in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend a summit called Texas Defendingthe American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventureslie did not attend the summit and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by adanceperformance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable the organizer of the summitwarned that Administration officials ""have a socialist visiOn for this country.""Five hundred people attended the summit which served in part as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. Anadvertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. ""Today the voices of average Americans arebeing drowned out by lobbyists and special interests"" it said. ""But you can do something about it."" The pitch made no mentionof its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .Axelrod Obama's senior adviser said ""What they don't say is that in part this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought toyou by a bunch of oil billionaires.""In April 2009 Melissa Cohlmia a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party sayingthat Americans for Prosperity is ""an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities."".Later she issued a statement: ""No funding has been provided by Koch companies the Koch foundations or Charles Koch orDavid Koch specifically to support the tea parties."" David Koch told New York ""I've never been to a tea-party event. No onerepresenting the tea party has ever even approached me.""At the lectern in Austin however Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans forProsperity and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: ""We love what the TeaParties are doing because that's how we're going to take back America!"" she declared as the crowd cheered. In a subsequentinterview she described herself as an early member of the movement joking ""I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!""She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help ""educate"" Tea Party activists on policy details and to givethem ""next-step training"" after their rallies so that their political energy could be channelled ""more effectively."" And she notedthat Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.""They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them and I'm very appreciative Ofwhat they do.""Venable honored several Tea Party ""citizen leaders"" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave itsBlogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th West writing on her site described Obama asthe ""cokehead in chief."" In an online thread West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of ""demonicpossession (aka schizophrenia etc.)."" The summit featured several paid speakers including Janine Turner the actress bestknown for her role on the television series ""Northern Exposure."" She declared ""They don't want our children to know abouttheir rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!""During a catered lunch Venable introduced Ted Cruz a former solicitor general of Texas who told the crowd that Obamawas ""the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office"" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—""the governmenttaking over our economy and our lives."" Countering Obama Cruz proclaimed was the epic fight of our generation!"" As thecrowd rose to its feet and cheered he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: ""Victory or death!""Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before thefirst Tax Day protests in April 2009 Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters ""Tea Party TalkingPoints."" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for""Taxpayer Tea Party Registration"" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. TheNorth Carolina branch recently launched a ""Tea Party Finder"" Web site advertised as ""a hub for all the Tea Parties in NorthCarolina.""The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to""educate"" fund and organize Tea Party protesters they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. BruceBartlett a conservative economist and a historian who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis a Dallas-basedthink tank that the Kochs fund said ""The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and noIndians. There haven't been any actual people like voters who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has beentrying to create a movement."" With the emergence of the Tea Party he said ""everyone suddenly sees that for the first time thereare Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power."" The Kochs he said are ""trying to shape and control andchannel the populist uprising into their own policies.""-A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party ""TheKoch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes and thefrogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!""The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead a prominent New York public-relationsexecutive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki the former governor of New York and MortimerZuckerman the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki a Republican who received campaign donations from David Kochcalled him ""a patriot who cares deeply about his country."" Zuckerman praised David's ""gentle decency"" and the ""range of hispublic interests.""The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities ""To call them under the radar is anunderstatement. They are underground!"" Another former Koch adviser said ""They're smart. This right-wing redneck stuffworks for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves."" Rob Stein a Democratic politicalstrategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances said that the Kochs are ""at the epicenter of the anti-Obamamovement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.""ddly enough the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutchprinter who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T. where he earned a degree in chemicalengineering. In 1927 he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but according to family loreAmerica's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home Kochfound work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regimeset up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time however Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch wasdeeply affected by the experience and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his companyRock Island Oil & Refining in Wichita he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had beendestroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega a former friend of Charles Koch recalled ""As the Soviets became astronger military power Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.""In 1958 Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society the arch-conservative group known inpart for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside Koch claimed that the Communists haveinfiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties."" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communistsin Italy and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. ""The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to takeover America"" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities where they would foment ""a vicious racewar."" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot Koch predicted that Communists would""infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist unknown to the rest of us.""Koch married Mary Robinson the daughter of a Missouri physician and they had four sons: Freddie Charles and twinsDavid and William. John Damgard the president of the Futures Industry Association was David's schoolmate and friend. Herecalled that Fred Koch was ""a real John Wayne type."" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits taking his sons big-game hunting inAfrica and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound acrossfrom Wichita's country club; in the summer the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool but they were not allowedto join them. ""By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age my father did me a big favor although it didn't seem like a favorback then"" Charles has written. ""By the time I was eight he made sure work occupied most of my spare time."" David Kochrecalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. ""He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrongwith government"" he told Brian Doherty an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason and the author of ""Radicals forCapitalism"" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. ""It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that biggovernment was bad and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.""David attended Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and Charles was sent to military school. Charles David and Williamall earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater M.I.T. and later joined the family company. Charles eventuallyassumed control with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard andstudied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him and punished him financially.(Freddie through a spokesperson denied this:)In 1967 after Fred Koch died of a heart attack Charles renamed the business Koch Industries in honor of his father. FredKoch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni atDeerfield where after pledging twenty-five million dollars he was made the school's sole ""lifetime trustee."" He said ""Youmight ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well let me tell you a story. It all started whenI was alittle boy. One day my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them forten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well this went on day after day week after week month after monthyear after year until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!""David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics but they did not share all his views according todiZerega who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore inWichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion to participate in an informal political-discussion group. ""It waspretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit"" diZerega recalled.DiZerega who has lost touch with Charles eventually abandOned right-wing views and became a political-scienceprofessor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy which set him on the path to academia; Charles isone of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a waywardintellectual trajectory transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government andseeing its expansion beginning with the New Deal as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay posted on Beliefnet diZeregawrites ""As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards.""Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-marketideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek the author of ""The Road toSerfdom"" (1944) which argued that centralized government planning led inexorably to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief inunfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately Tea Party supportershave championed his work. In June the talk-radio host Glenn Beck who has supported the Tea Party rebellion promoted ""TheRoad to Serfdom"" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of theKochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore Beck said without explanation ""I want to thank Charles Koch for thisinformation."" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker Robert LeFevre who favored the abolition of the statebut didn't like the label ""anarchist""; he called himself an ""autarchist."" LeFevre liked to say that ""government is a diseasemasquerading as its own cure."" In 1956 he opened an institution called the Freedom School in Colorado Springs. BrianDoherty of Reason told me that ""LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart"" and that the school was ""a tinyworld of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake."" According to diZerega Charles supported the schoolfinancially and even gave him money to take classes there.Throughout the seventies Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980 William with assistance fromFreddie attempted to take over the company from Charles who they felt had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation thecompany's board which answered to Charles fired William. (""Charles runs it all with an iron hand"" Bruce Bartlett theeconomist told me.) Lawsuits were filed with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remainedand litigation continued for seventeen more years with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990 they walked pastone another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco which has no income tax.He bought historic estates in France. Austria and elsewhere filling them with art antiques opera scores and literarymanuscripts. William founded his own energy company Oxbow and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-fivemillion dollars to win the America's Cup in 1992.With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O. Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman who heads theinvestment-banking firm Evercore told me that the company's performance has been ""beyond phenomenal."" Charles remainedin Wichita with his wife and two children guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to NewYork City where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. Afinancial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me ""Charles is the company. Charles runs it."" David described byassociates as ""affable"" and ""a bit of a lunk"" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South ofFrance and bought a waterfront home in Southampton where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likenedto an ""East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees."" In 1996 he married Julia Flesher a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan andmore genial than that of Charles Brian Doherty who has interviewed both brothers couldn't think of a single issue on whichthe brothers disagreed.As their fortunes grew Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics inAmerica. Charles's goal as Doherty described it was to tear the government ""out at the root."" The brothers' first major publicstep came in 1979 when Charles persuaded David then thirty-nine to run for public office. They had become supporters of theLibertarian Party and were backing its Presidential candidate Ed Clark who was running against Ronald Reagan from theright. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations they contrived to place David on the ticket in the Vice-Presidentialslot; upon becoming a candidate he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket'sslogan was ""The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You."" In fact its primary source of funds was David Kochwho spent more than two million dollars on the effort.Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation thatlibertarians were getting ready to stage ""a very big tea party"" because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The LibertarianParty platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. as well as of federal regulatory agencies such as theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security minimum-wagelaws gun control and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution recreational drugsand suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley Jr. amore traditional conservative called the movement ""Anarcho-Totalitarianism.""That November the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand ofpolitics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. ""It tends to be a nastycorrupting business"" he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" According to Doherty'sbook the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochstold Doherty that the brothers wanted to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the direction ofAmerica they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.""fter the 1980 election Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch familyfoundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations three of which they founded and several of whichthey direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns advocacy groups andlobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang of the liberal blog ThinkProgresshas called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.""Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe CharitableFoundation which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife along with two company employees and an accountant spentmore than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.Meanwhile since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately the company'spolitical-action committee KochPAC has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns more than eightyper cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010 Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in politicalcontributions as it has since 2006. In addition during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family membershave personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010 DavidKoch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association with a million-dollar donation.Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politicallyactive nonprofit groups.In recent decades members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. Inthe nineteen-eighties the Olin family which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate became known for fundingright-leaning thinking in academia particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife a descendant ofAndrew Mellon spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt a vice-president at theDemocratic-leaning Web site Media Matters said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual in its marshalling of corporate and personalfunds: ""Their role in terms of financial commitments is staggering.""Of course Democrats give money too. Their most prominent donor the financier George Soros runs a foundation theOpen Society Institute that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generousprivate contributions to various Democratic campaigns including Obama's. But Michael Vachon his spokesman argued thatSoros's giving is transparent and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests."" The Kochshave given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.Gus diZerega the former friend suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into arationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles ""Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.""Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law charitablefoundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the NationalCommittee for Responsive Philanthropy a watchdog group described the Kochs' foundations as being self-servingconcluding ""These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact theprofit margin of Koch Industries.""The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest however funding organizations that aim to push thecountry in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice which files.lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies which underwrites libertarian academics; andthe Bill of Rights Institute which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by theKochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch hasacknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going to give a lot of money we'll make darn sure they •spend it in a way that goes along with our intent"" he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things wedon't agree with we withdraw funding.""he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills in many ways the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo thatLewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwarmovement had turned its anger on defense contractors such as Dow Chemical and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interestcrusade against corporations. Powell writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged American companies to fightback. The greatest threat to free enterprise he warned was not Communism or the New Left but rather ""respectable elementsof society""—intellectuals journalists and scientists. To defeat them he wrote business leaders needed to wage a long-term• unified campaign to change public opinion.Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. ""To bring aboutsocial change"" he told Doherty requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated"" spanning ""from ideacreation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The projecthe admitted was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy"" he said.In 1977 the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. According to the'Center for Public Integrity between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Catohas more than a hundred full-time employees and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by themainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it hasconsistently pushed for corporate tax cuts reductions in social services and laissez-faire environmental policies.When President Obama in a 2008 speech described the science on global warming as ""beyond dispute"" the Cato Institutetook out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts tostop global warming as expensive ineffective and unnecessary. Ed Crane the Cato Institute's founder and president told methat ""global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.""Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year private e-mails of climatescientists at the University of East Anglia in England were mysteriously leaked and their exchanges appeared to suggest awillingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails wentpublic one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquirieshave since exonerated the researchers and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus onglobal warming. •Nevertheless the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal moreAmericans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. TheKochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fosteringsuch doubt.In a 2002 memo the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensusabout global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmentalreform he said was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years toforestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism such as the Heritage Foundation whichhas argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""The brothers have given money to more obscure groups too such as the Independent Women's Forum which opposes thepresentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008 the group was run by NancyPfotenhauer a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary is on the group'sboard.Naomi Oreskes a professor of history and science studies at the University of California San Diego is the co-author of""Merchants of Doubt"" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion onscience. She noted that the Kochs as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines"" have ""a lot at stake."" She added""If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels a different group of people are going to be making money so we shouldn't besurprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it hasbeen he said the heating of the planet will be beneficial resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. ""TheEarth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food"" he said.n the mid-eighties the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University in Arlington Virginia to set up anotherthink tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-orientedideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch familyfoundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason much of which has gone to the MercatusCenter a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington"" Rob Stein the Democratic strategistsaid. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university and receives public funds"" Stein noted. ""Virginia ishosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbyingoperation in Washington. In addition he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation the president of theClaude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation and a director and co-founder with David Koch of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.Fink with his many titles has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted EdCrane the head of the Cato Institute as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at CatoCharles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles'smanagement philosophy which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success"" and trademarked under the nameMarket-Based Management or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with thecompetitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision virtueand talents knowledge processes decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he'sa genius. He's the emperor and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink by contrast has been far more embracing ofCharles's ideas. (Fink like the Kochs declined to. be interviewed.)At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the MercatusCenter's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual rawmaterials into policy ""products.""The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of"" and notedthat fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first byMercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles"" and that the MercatusCenter does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity a law professor at the University ofTexas who specializes in environmental issues told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A. andMercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center calledit ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to aneutral-sounding think tank"" which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""In 1997 for instance the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone a form of pollution caused in part by emissions from oilrefineries. Susan Dudley an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center criticized the proposed rule. TheE.P.A. she argued had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected thatif pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.In 1999 the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule the courtfound that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion thecourt ruled 2-1 that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the ConstitutionalAccountability Center a think tank revealed the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets on a Montanaranch that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch familyfoundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.deas don't happen on their own"" Matt Kibbe the president of Freedom Works a Tea Party advocacy group told me.""Throughout history ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers after helping to create Cato and Mercatus concluded that thinktanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street and to attract thepublic's support. in 1984 David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The groupCitizens for a Sound Economy seemed like a grassroots movement but according to the Center for Public Integrity it wassponsored principally by the Kochs who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission Kibbe said ""was to takethese heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolentrevolutions--Saul _Minsky Gandhi Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example ofnonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas not candidates."" Within a few years thegroup had mobilized fifty paid field workers in twenty-six states to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charlesaccording to one participant were ""very controlling very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""Around this time the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989 the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigatedtheir business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oilfrom Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-onemillion dollars' worth of crude oil but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oilmeasurement is ""a very uncertain art.""To defend its reputation Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soonopened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations but it eventually disbanded withoutissuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personallives of committee staffers even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Battenthe counsel to the Senate committee said ""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'.'By •1993 when Bill Clinton became President Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind ofcorporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault onClinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy for instance running advertisements staging media events and targeting opponents.And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts ofwavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman a former Democratic congressman from Wichita who supported the B.I.U. tax recalled""I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of'resources and effort—their employees too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it but I think I was probablytheir victim"" he said.The Kochs continued to disperse their money creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names and this madeit difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990 Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoffgroup Citizens for the Environment which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When thePittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""In 1997 another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millionsof dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source"" in order to evadecampaign-finance laws. A shell corporation Triad Management had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads intwenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit groupthe Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or inpart by Charles and David Koch of Wichita Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack adsmost of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas where Triad Management was especially activethe funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs when asked by reporters if they had given themoney refused to comment. In i998 however the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll hadbeen involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was thefirst time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child ofa company run amok.""uring the Clinton Administration the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties the JusticeDepartment filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spillswhich had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as twohundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine and agreed tospend five million dollars on environmental projects.In 1999 a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosionthat resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001 the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the finalmonths of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company forcovering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene a carcinogen from its refinery in Corpus Christi Texas. The companywas liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations includingthe falsification of documents and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann a career prosecutor who at the timeheaded the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases everbrought under the Clean Air Act."" He added ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arroganceand in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""During the 2000 election campaign Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidaciesof George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyedremarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill offeredenormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks but according to astudy by Media Matters their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since2000.In 2004 Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. Thegroup's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot in order to dilute Democratic support forJohn Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan politicalpurposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)That year internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Finkstarted a new group Americans for Prosperity and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who hadworked with Ralph Reed the evangelical leader and Republican activist co-founding Century Strategies a campaign-consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biographydescribes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an evengreater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics calledPhillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""Last year Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.Currently its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size the Kochs' political involvement hasbeen intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity in concert with the family's otherorganizations has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.In January 2008 Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss ofliberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That October Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives ata Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com took the lecternthanked David Koch and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office Americansfor Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released areport claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually the author wasforced to correct the report but not before Rush Limbaugh citing.the paper had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund"" andFox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen the vice-president for policy at Americans forProsperity is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity Walter Williams oftenguest-hosts for Limbaugh.)Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot Patients United Now which organized what Phillips has estimated to bemore than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; atanother protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protestsoutside the Capitol in March where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.Phillips was a featured speaker.Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation which is aimed at makingindustries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed with exaggeration that even back-yardbarbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar VanJones and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting his group as a champion of ordinary workers who wouldbe hurt by environmentalists Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conferenceon climate change declaring ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthyfamilies . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""Grover Norquist who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington including representatives fromAmericans for Prosperity told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. TheRepublican leadership in Congress he said ""couldn't have clone it without August when people went out on the streets. Itdiscouraged deal-makers""—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover theappearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollarweathervane"" Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong the Chamber of Commerce said 'We can work with the ObamaAdministration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is whatchanged it. Now that Obama is weak people are getting tough.""As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphantAmericans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working withthe Administration on health care or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude and Tea Party groupswere accusing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech Koch said ""Days like today bring to reality thevision of our board of directors when we started this organization five years ago."" He went on ""We envisioned a massmovement a state-based one but national in scope of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of lifestanding up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfullythe stirrings from California to Virginia and from Texas to Michigan show that more and more of our fellow-citizens arebeginning to see the same truths as we do."" .While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day more recently he has come close to doing sopraising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in governmentpower the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employeescompared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense ofimperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties andsince the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message hasevidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.Americans for Prosperity meanwhile has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before themidterm elections in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates it nonethelessplans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races staging rallies organizing door-to-door canvassing andrunning ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink interviewedby FrumForum.com this spring said ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now with the expansion ofgovernment spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country it doesn't look very good at all."" He went on ""Itlooks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" He suggested that the Kochs needed ""to getmore into the practical day-to-day issues of governing.""n 1991 David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As hewas recovering a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment settled down started afamily and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane andeveryone.else died—yeah you think 'My God the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've beenbusy ever since doing all the good work 1 can think of so He can have confidence in me.""Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer researchfocussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-Presbyterian Hospital a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research twenty million to Johns HopkinsUniversity and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. In response to his generosity Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004 President Bush named him to the National CancerAdvisory Board which guides the National.Cancer Institute.Koch's corporate and political roles however may pose conflicts of interest. For example at the same time that DavidKoch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent theE.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde which the company produces in great quantities as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats and several major scientific studies have concludedthat formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute on•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposedto higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel withinthe National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen and be strictlycontrolled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades however and KochIndustries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A. requiring it to defer new regulationsuntil more studies are completed.Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005 after it bought Georgia-Pacific the paper and wood-products company for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division and usesit to produce various wood products such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2billion pounds. Last December Traylor Champion Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs sent a formalletter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusionthat formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the NationalCancer Advisory Board or divest himself of company stock while his company was directly lobbying the government to keepformaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)James Fluff an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences a division of the N.I.H. toldme that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.Vested interests should not be on the board."" He 'went on ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as towhether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""Harold Vannus the director of the National Cancer Institute knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering which heused to run. He said that at Sloan-Kettering ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing wewouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde Varmus said thathe was ""surprised.""he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History is a multimediaexploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance viewers are confrontedwith a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years which notes that it is far cooler now than itwas ten thousand years ago. Overhead the text reads ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" Themessage as amplified by the exhibit's Web site is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response toenvironmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE"" is it notedthat levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been and that they are projected to increasedramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible roleplayed by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says ""Duringthe period in which humans evolved Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmospherefluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climatechange in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short compact bodies"" or ""curved spines""so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees for instance argueS that""fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity"" and concludes ""Since we can't control Mother Nature let's figure outhow to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org is infuriated by theSmithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue"" he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted tobe seen as some sort of high-minded company associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.But the truth is the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to dealwith this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""Cristian Samper the museum's director said that the exhibit is not about climate change and described Koch as ""one of thebest donors we've had in my tenure here because he's very interested in the content but completely hands off."" He noted ""1.don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate whatDavid Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Partyand with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. RecentlyPresident °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser inAustin he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down lawsprohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups withharmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said ""They don't have to say who exactly Americans forProsperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even he added ""a big oil company."""

Oscar can u print this asap for hrc. Its for her 9:30am call. Thx.
"E-MAIL:obilolo@netscape.net E-MAIL:bello_dd@doctor.com Dear Friend, My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year there was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities homeless. A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been completed and the original contractor has long been paid,but the contract balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK, This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of the country for ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones. To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount into your account. We are ready to share this money with you on the basis of participation.we also have plans to invest part of this money in any viable business in your country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement age. In any case, I received a reference of you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry =91Foreign Trade Division=92as a reputable organ that can assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply to me on my e-mail:(bello_dd@doctor.com)or(obilolo@netscape.net) so that I can provide you with the basic procedures for the release of the fund.  It does not matter whether you or your company does contract project of the nature described here, the assumption is that you won a major contract and subcontracted it to another company, more often thannot, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside to cover any expenses thatmay be incurred by both parties during this transaction, both local and international. Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction could be accomplished within the shortest possible time based on your interest and determination,since the money is already on transit."

Mylate father was among the few black Zimbabwean richfarmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of theruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for hisalleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean oppositionparty. Before the death of my father, he took me toSouthAfrica to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars($12m) with a security and finance company, as if heknew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money wasdeposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid muchdumourage from the security firm.This money was earmarked for the purchase of newmachinery and chemicals for the farms and theestablishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when President R. MUGABEintroduced a new land Act. which wholly affects theWhite rich farmers and some few blacks vehementlycondemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by thegovernment. This resulted to rampant killing and mobactions. I and my family who are currently staying inSouthAfrica as refugees or asylum seekers have decidedto enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of theTrunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futhertransfer of the money to a foreign country where wecan invest it. I am faced with the dilemma ofclaiming/investing this amount of money in SouthAfrica for fear of encountering the same experience infuture since both countries have the same politicalhistory. Moreover, the South African monetarypolicy/law doesnot allow such investment hence I am seeking foran asylum or refugee.I must let you know that this business is 100% riskfree and the nature of your business does notnecessary matter. So if you are willing to assist usclaim the ownership of this money,I and my family haveagreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will befor a joint business venture I will be doing with youand another 35% will be for me and my family which weshall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%will be mapped out for all expenses we may incureduring the transaction.Therefor, if you are willing and interested to renderthe needed assistance.

"Dear one,  After much prayer my spirit has directed me to confide in you this top confidencial issue regarding my present predicament.Brief information about myself, my name is Miss Rita Umu., the only surviving daugther of late Mr Wilson Umu may his soul rest in perfect peace. Before the death of my father, he was a cocoa merchant and he was also in the government of my country. He was assasinated with the my mother and my two elder brothers by the rebels during the heat of the war in my country. The rebels claim that my father was in surport of the government during the war that devided my country into two part.Luckily for me, I was away in the burden school in Ghana a neighbouring country. It was on the BBC Africa that I heard about the tragic death of my parents and brothers but my father was still alive at the time of gun shot and was ruched to the hospital. I was taken to the hospital where he was recieving treatment for gun wounds. One week before his death, he called me to his bed side at the hospital and handed a document to me. The document is covering a deposit of nine  million five hundred thausand U.S dollars (U.S$9.5 000.000.00) which he deposited in a security company vault here in my home country. According to him he said this money is meant to establish his business in europe after his retirement. He instructed me to look for a trust worthy partner in over sea to confide the release of the fund into his account and relocate to his country to establish the money on a lucrative business and live my life quietly. He also said that the security company does not know the content of the safe Box, that he deposited the contents as family valuable.Why am contacting you, I need your assistance in the following:1.provide a bank account were the fund will be transfered in.2.Help to pay for the clearance document charges.3.Help to invest the money on a lucrative investment in your country.4. Send me an invitation letter to arrange my travel to your country soon as the transfer is effected into your account.5.Help to manage the investment for the minimum of five years.6.Serve as my partner and guidiance in your country during my relocation to your country.Regarding this transaction, I offer you 10% as compensation and 5% for all expences over the transaction immediately the transfer is made into your account."
"A German man called Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter, 66 years of age and a prosperous farmer had deposited with us a sum of TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS(U.S.$20Million). His wife Mrs. Helga Schiniter is the legitimate beneficiary to this account. Unfortunately they were both killed in the air crash involving Concord AF4590 in Gonesse, France. Our serch through the german embassy to find any of the next of kin, have all proved fruitless. According to the embassy, the couple had no offspring. The Firm is still unrelenting in its effort to contact any of the relatives for possible claim of this money, or the fund will be transfared to the government cofferes. In order to avoid this development, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter so that the funds would be released to you. All the documents and proofs of identity to further enable you get these funds will be worked out. We ""the Firm"", have secured the order of mandamus fom the court to serch and locate any of the deceased relatives. This is why I am asking you to present yourself as the possible closest next of kin.I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount, I has also map out 10% for any expenses that might come during the process of the transaction, why 60% will be for me.  Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me If your good self accsept to this request, I will then commence with the procuement of the necessary documents to back your claim as the next of kin. Thanks, we wait to hear from you. Yours sincerely MR JAMES TSHABALALA. "

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up  to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than Eight  years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.   In view of this I got your contact through a search on the internet .I  shall   give you 40% of the total sum .I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and thatyou should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to thedeceased.When you receive this letter.

PIR <preinesThursday September 2 2010 6:33 PMHCDM; Huma Abedin; Lona Valmoro; Jake SullivanJoint InterviewMS —Jake just relayed yoLir desire to cancel tomorrow's interview. But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things thathe was not in a position to share:1) The Israeli & Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at greatcost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas.2) Both the Israeli & Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping itsunprecedented nature3) Because of #2 U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning.So three points:1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview occurring and canceling no matter the reason cited will betaken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today andcanceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israelimedia and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to bewe run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling.Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. Iunderstand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment but first that doesn't mean you have toand second you know they won't really refrain. And I am certain they will appreciate the effusive things you have to sayabout them during this interview. Not to mention that the reason for canceling is something we ourselves could haveforeseen before going so far down the road and should have - which I don't think is fair or reflects well on you.Lastly on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant andexclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks and I guarantee you that will be far more painful thantomorrow's relative short and peaceful format.If you'd like to discuss I'm at my desk and available or can call you through Ops.
Sounds good.
OMG!You are so fabulous!

"I am Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi a member of the PresidentialPayment Verification Committee (PPVC) of the FederalGovernment of Nigeria, West Africa and also a Directorof Project Implementation with the NNPC. I ampresently on assignment with my colleagues in theministry of finance and the presidency carrying outroutine verification of contractual claims on behalfof the NNPC I apologize for using this medium to reach you for aTransaction/business of this magnitude, but this isdue to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed onthis medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want tocount on you, as a respected and honest person tohandle this transaction with sincerity, trust andconfidentiality.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operationwith you in the process of actualising our dreamsdescribed hereunder. For the benefit of all partiesand hope you will keep it in confidence because of thenature of this transaction within the NNPC andMinistry of Finance (FMF), where I work as Director ofProject Implementation.With the cooperation of four other top officials, wehave in our possession overdue payment bills which weare presently verifying, to the tune of Twenty SixMillion, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars(US$26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad withthe assistance and cooperation of a foreigncompany/individual to receive the said fund on ourbehalf or a reliable foreign non-company account toreceive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, asthe Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us tooperate offshore account hence your importance in thewhole transaction. This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the totalcontract value executed on behalf of the NigerianNational Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by a foreigncontracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiceddeliberately in the course of our verificationexercise. Though the actual contract cost have beenpaid to the original contractor, leaving the balancein the tune of the said amount which we have inprinciple gotten approval to remit by Key TestedTelegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bankaccount you will provide by filing in an applicationto NNPC and the Ministry of Finance for the transferof Rights and Privileges to the contractual sum toyou/your account. I have the authority of my partners involved topropose that should you be willing to assist us in thetransaction, your share of the sum would be 30% ofthe $26.5million, 60% for us, while 10% has been mapped out from the total =sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this =transfer, both locally and international expenses.. The business itself is100% safe, on your part provided you treat it withutmost secrecy and confidentiality. Your area of specialization is not a hindrance to thesuccessful execution of this transaction. I havereposed my confidence in you and hope that youwould not disappoint me. Should you be interested or not in this transaction, "

I just want to say that as I brief the QDDR (20 times and counting) one of the points that makesthe strongest impression and that I frankly think is an enormous part of your intellectual andpractical legacy is putting together all the bureaus that focus on protecting individuals — protectingthem from insurgent or criminal violence (CCO and INL) protecting their rights through law(DRL GTIP S/WCI) or meeting their basic needs in humanitarian emergencies (PRM). It is amajor statement about the direction that the world is going and we must follow. This was reallyyour idea and it is a powerful one. I know your decision today and applaud it.

"FROM THE DESK OF:MR XIAO GANG,BANK OF OVERSEAS CHINESETAIPEI,TAIWANDear Friend,How are you today and business in your country? I am Mr.Xiao Gang, Bank Manager,Bank Of Overseas Chinese North Shyn Lin District, Taipei, Taiwan. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. I know you would be wondering why I am writing you with a request such as this but I only urge you to read on.In November 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Mark Kogan, made a Fixed Deposit  of the sum of US$10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which accumulated  to the sum of US$20,160,176.00 (Twenty Million, One hundred and sixty thousand, One hundred and seventy six United States Dollars for twelve calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address in America and Britain but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.Mark Kogan died alongside his wife, from an airplane crash. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; Mr. Mark Kogan died interstate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. This sum of US$20,160,176.00 has since been sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to the Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$20,160,176.00 deposited in my bank, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased, which I shall provide you with, is presented. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Bank of overseas chinese is concerned, the bank's management has no single idea of what=92s the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man=92s family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. mark kogan so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple, all you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary authentication, approval and a letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer to be done. A bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiaryext of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share 90/10.I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and i wont let it pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. There is no risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested in this lucrative role, I urge you to indicate to that effect. Upon your response, if favourable, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant information that will help you get full understanding of the transaction. I will appreciate it if you send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easier communication.If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this email address. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences may be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.

"Zhang He, Bank of China.. ShenzhenChina. Dear Friend, I am Zhang He, Bank Manager of the Bank of China, Shenzhen branch, China. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 7, 2000, a consultant/ contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at Twenty One Million Dollars (US$21,000,000.00) only in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation that he died along with his wife from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died Without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of China, at the expiration of eight (8) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to assist me in receiving this money as I have every machinery set to enable you receiver this money via a Finance firm based overseas. I need your urgent assistance so that this money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will require you to send me your complete names, contact address and telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to apply for the necessary documents to enable you receive the money via the Finance firm overseas in your name. After receiving the money, we will share in the ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you. Note that the project will be 100% risk free. Considering my position as the credit officer of the bank, I guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. I have the facilities to obtain relevant documents to enable me lift the money from the bank overseas. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I will also let you have the contact details of the Finance Firm and the country it is located in Overseas. Please send me your confidential TELEPHONE and FAX Numbers for fast communication, as I will need to speak to you to personally. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Please reply through my secure email zhanghe_1967@163.com Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.  Zhang He."

"DearI salute you in the name of the most High! My name is Mrs. Rose Ameeraly.Am a widow and a mother of two girls. We do not know each other and I'm wondering how you will view this letter. Please, accept my sincere apology. Sorry, about taking your time as well. I will be highly obliged if you can assist me in this business. My Husband is an Nigerian while I am a Ghanaian. My late husband, David Ameeraly, was a loving, caring and hardworking businessman. Prior to his death by plane crash, he was living with us in Accra, Ghana. He died November 1st 1990. This sad event occurred during one of his business trips to the US. Please, find below the website for more information. If you go through this publication critically, you will find my husband's name, David Ameeraly amongst others that lost their life on that fateful day as published by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stmBBefore the sudden death of my beloved husband, he planned to establish a business in Europe with the sum of US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). Unfortunately, he died before this venture could materialize. Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his properties (assets and money).Since I am a woman and my offsprings are all girls coupled with the fact that I do not have a male child, I was put under terrible pressure to stay clear from my legitimate husband estates According to their family culture/traditional believe, a woman is not allowed to run latehusband business and worst of all, I was asked to move into David's younger brother's household as one of his wives. My problem started when I refused to be inherited by David's younger brother. Fortunately,  the proposed investment fund US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars only). that was deposited with the investment/security company was unknown to the family. As such, they did not ask for this. If not, it would have been a problem as there would have been nothing to fall back on. It's only our lawyer & my humble self that know of this fund. I have discussed this matter with the Finance company were the fund was lodged. This is the asset I have left and I need part of this money for my daughters school fees and to maintain my personal life as well. David's family was vehemently against my daughters education. All they intend doing,was to give them out for marriage at a tender age. According to the staff of the finance company, the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money into an alternative bank account for safekeeping.Later it will be used for business investment which is subject to the advise of whoever that will be assisting us finally.For obvious reasons, I do not want the finance company's involvement.This transaction must be handled under strict confidentiality. At this juncture, I thought it wise to solicit your indispensable assistance to receiving this fund on my behalf. I do not have knowledge of funds management & business in general. I was a full-time housewife.Therefore, this step depends on your trust-worthiness & ability to handle funds of this magnitude. All that is required of you, is to forward to me by email, your direct phone, fax, address or any other information you may deem helpful. I need the requested information for the purpose of securing the relevant documents in your name as my confidante/ bona fide beneficiary. Please, note that this transaction is legitimate and 100% hitch-free. We will not violate any known law of my country and that of yours. So, be rest-assured.However, as soon as I receive your positive response to the above business transaction, I shall provide you with necessary transfer details. Note also, that you must convince me of your trust-worthiness and ability to keep secret. I have decided to compensate you with 30%of the total money as a reward for your sincere assistance and the remaining 70% will be used to pursue my late husband's investment dream in real estate.Thanking you for your anticipated response as I look forward to hearingfrom you.I remain.Sincerely yours,Mrs.Rose David Ameeraly "

I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a =reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to =reveal to you.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) =for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my =bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account =officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address =but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. =On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=92s family wife and =two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, =including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under =dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the =investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U.

By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law =which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not =for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to =late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as =Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, =with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. =All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and =there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under =a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =U.

Russians are saying he is unavailable and don't know when or if he will call in. What's next step?
I need to call Karzai Shaun Woodward and then Robinson and McGinness and now maybe Kouchner. But I don't wantto do until later today or tomorrow. Do I have time tomorrow? I will need to allocate 30 minutes to Karzai.
Tomorrow will give you a cleaner version but you could get the current draft this morning if today is better for youwork-wise.

"From your clips:US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday October 5 2009 AFPWASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State HillaryClinton said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody.In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama the State Department noted that theUS government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed ""numerous cases of rape and sexualviolence in Sri Lanka particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government.""However the letter signed by Melanne Verveer ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Departmentsaid that ""in the most recent phase of the conflict from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape andsexual abuse were used as tools of war as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world.""""We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context"" the letter said adding that Washington remainsconcerned about extrajudicial killings disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka.""Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and theprotection of human rights"" the letter said.Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the UnitedNations Security Council.""We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere"" the US secretary of statehad said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict according to published reports ofClinton's remarks.Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels afterdecades of fighting.Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to staveoff a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia.The United Nations has said that over 7000 civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year.Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free 250000 ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fightingbut are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels.B6"

"Hello,My name is Mrs.Jennifer Wilson I am a dying woman who had decided to donate what I have to you. I am 59 years old and was diagnosed for cancer about 2 years ago,immediately after the death of my husband, who had left me everything he worked for.I have been touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to the you for the good work of God,rather than allow my relatives to use my husband's hard earned funds ungodly.I  have asked God to forgive me all my sins and i believe he has because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation,and i pray that i survive the operation. I have decided to WILL/donate the sum of $1,500,000(One million five hundred thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and to help the motherless,less privileged and also for the assistance of the widows.At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls, due to the fact that my relatives are around me and i have been restricted by my doctor from taking telephone calls because i deserve all thee rest i can get.Presently,I have informed my lawyer about my decision in WILLING this fund to you.I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others. Kindly Contact my lawyer through this email address >(brownwalter03@yahoo.com)if you are interested in carrying out this task,so that he can arrange the release of the funds ($1,500,000.00) to you.My lawyer's name is Brown Walter."

As I have said repeatedly I do not want to see Palau shortchanged. I do not know whether this assessment is accurateso can I pls get an update and recommendation about to take care of this?
"manager of Petrochemical service here in London, a chemical engineer by profession. And then, nobody knows about this account or anything concerning it.I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to any local bank here in London, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is United State Dollars? And the former owner of the account was Mr. Rafik Hariri and he was a foreigner too. Finally, at the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me ,while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of this transaction. Yours Sincerely, Dr. Kingsley William Mark "
I have his email B6May have his cell too- ill check my files
So what's the verdict on the article?
"Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR. MARK ELLIS, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER of the CITY CENTER TRUST BANK.I have an obscured business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I did not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium, sorry my English is not very good. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client MAJOR FADI EL AMIN who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ten millions United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several Notices was sent to him, even during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that MAJOR FADI EL AMIN did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Ten millions United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the England Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to MAJOR FADI EL AMIN so that you will be able to receive his funds.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.

"AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.                            (TOP SECRET)Dear Friend,I MR PASCAL DUNGA, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of bank AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died  in  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was Ten US$10,000,000.00 (TEN Million Dollars)As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through the Burkina-faso chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso.Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and my partners. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""top secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from you."
I would simply reiterate the need for a statement *FAST* and say that the embassy can follow up. This will help both ofus.

"I am Mrs. Jewel Howard Taylor, an Americo-Liberian bybirth and wife of embattled President of war torn Liberia, Mr CharlesTaylor. I am an economist by profession. My husband was just caught inNigeria, but matters were not helped when UN Special War Crimes Court for Sierra Leone indicted my husband for warcrimes , demanding his prosecution.  I am awaiting theoutcome of events in my country, and what will become of me and my husband inasylum. The reason is this. During the political crisis some years agoin Sierra Leone (West African Country rich in diamonds), my husband wasactively involved.Early this year, he entrusted some large quantities ofdiamonds to me. Fearing its detection due to the volume, myson (Williams) traveled to Dublin,Ireland with the diamonds (on myinstructions) and sold them, getting a total of US$28,000,000.00 (Twenty Eight million US Dollars only). This money he moved into a safe Finance Housefor protective custody under a different name.Now, the  government of Dublin,Ireland has refused issuingneither him nor my family any visa to travel to their country againbecause of the current political situation. This is why I need you to please to  claim this money and subsequently depositsame in a reputable bank there for onward transfer to your account, or toinstruct the safe house to move the funds out of there  to any of theircorresponding banks or offices in London or Europe for onwardtransfer to your account.I am also willing to forfeit any percentage you want. My only daughter Helen died in October 1999 fromcomplications of pneumonia. Please note that my husband is not evenaware that I sold the diamonds, If you cannot help us, simply destroy and forget Iever contacted you.   May God guide you in whatever you decide, and thankyou for taking out time to read this request.Fondest regards.Mrs. Jewel Howard Taylor====================== "

Oops my email acting up.Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you okdoing this call in the next day or so?Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house.Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of thecourt decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance ofhis continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal.Background: On August 11 2009 a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout(pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraftmissiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai AttorneyGeneral's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaningChairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.
"                     Dear Sir, It is my great pleasure to write you this letter onbehalf of my colleagues. Your information were givento me by a member of the South African ExportPromotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the BlackEconomic Empowerment Commission (Government)delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreigninvestors. I have decided to seek a confidentialco-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunderfor the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keepit confidential because of the nature of thisbusiness. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I workas the Director of Project Implementation, withco-operation of two other top officials, we have inour possession, an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of thecontract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by aforeign contracting firm, which we the officialsover-invoiced to the amount ofUS$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five HundredThousand United States Dollars). Though the actualcontract cost has been paid to the originalcontractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believethat private investment in general, and foreign directinvestment in particular, are the real engines forsustainable economic development, for which reason ithas continued to encouraged investment in the keygrowth-oriented sector of Mining with sinceredetermination to pay foreign contractors all debtsowed to them, so as to continue to enjoy closerelationship, and mutually beneficial co-operationwith foreign governments and non-governmentalfinancial agencies. As a result we included our billsfor approvals with the co-operation of some officialsat the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank ofSouth Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance tobe the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since weare not allowed to operate foreign account. Thechanging of beneficiary's information/ details andother forms of documentation upon application forclaim to reflect the contract money and its approvalswill be secured on behalf of your company or yourself. I have the authority of my colleagues involved topropose that, should you be willing to assist us inthis transaction your share as compensation will be20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, andthe balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse allexpenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses soincurred. It does not matter whether or not your company doescontract projects of the nature described here. Theassumption is that your company won the major contractand subcontracted it to other companies. More oftenthan not, big trading companies and firms of unrelatedfields win major contracts, and subcontract to morespecialized firms for execution. This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treatit with utmost confidentiality. Also yourspecialization is not a hindrance to the successfulexecution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. Ihave reposed my confidence in you and hope that youwill not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for furtherdetails, upon your acceptance of this proposal.Pls send all correspondence to potobo1@netscape.net Regards,Engr Paul O. Otobo.potobo1@netscape.net"

I am =contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country =has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private =company in that region, as the present political instability in my country =(Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not =conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed,just as =reported by the International media.I wouldn't go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this web-site if =you have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.http://www.rte.ieews/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership =of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more =than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have =been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these =periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 =white farmers were killed, the government didn't stop at this, as just =recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms =to black farmers or risk going to prison.Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no =other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. =Therefore, I decided to contact you for your assistance so that I can =establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must =re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the =owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your =country.I have deposited in a Security company all the funds realised from the sales =of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to =USD8.5,000,000.00 (Eight million five hundred thousand United States =Dollars). These  funds was packaged in two trunk boxes and declared as =Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company and not to know =of the exact  content so that they don't steal my money.It is to the =knowledge of you and i that it is money that is in the trunk boxes.The trunk =boxes of us$8.5m have been arranged and securely sealed, crated and then =deposited with a security company ready for shipment abroad via diplomatic =courier service so as to make it immune to custom and other bureaucratic =checks at the ports. The reason for this is because it is the only way the funds can be =transferred without any problems.For now, I stay in U A E because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my =family. You can mail your immediate response to me. Upon your immediate =response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation =that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the =security company. Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% =risk free and shouldalso be handled in the most confidential manner.I have options to offer you, first you can choose to have certain percentage =of the money for your assistance, or you can go into partnership for a proper =profitable investment of the money in your country. Which ever option you =choose, feel free to notify me. If for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you =25% of the money while the  remaining 75% that is meant for me, will be for =the investment in your country.So based on the above, it is important you communicatewith me. On the event =that you cannot assist me to do the business, I beg you to still keep my =contact andexistence of my fund a secret. I also require you to make available to me the following 1)Your Complete name. 2)Your confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me comminicate with =you easily.  Sincerely Yours,HASSAN   GEORGE   .  --4a18597d-f3c5-442c-8a01-ce61efc66310--"

I got the invite for she schwarzenegger conf last night. Its in calif from sept 29-oct 2nd. III get info to both of u
"Dear friend, Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mailand I urge you to treat it serious. However strange or surprising. This contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and the immense benefit it will be to you and I.We want to transfer to overseas account ($3,000.000.00 USD) (Three Million United States Dollars) from a Diamond Bank Ltd here in Senigal,I want to ask you,If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive thismoney, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this importantbusiness trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future. I am Mr Martins Dele, the Auditor General of Diamond Bank here in Senigal. During the course of our auditing, I discovered a floatingfund in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and since 2002 nobody has operated on this account again,after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floatingand if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. Theowner of this account is Mr. FORREST STEPHEN DeMARTINO of Sidney,Ohio United States of America. Who was involved in an {AIR CRASH} that occurred on Jan Thursday 9th 2003 With an air craft {US Airways Express Flight 5481 } which crashed Wednesday at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, killing all 21 aboard passenger. Since the management got the information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or his next of kin to come up and claim his money.Unfortunately, From the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim.The banking and financial law of Diamond Bank stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period of (3-4)Three-four years, it will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. On this discovery, I decided to do businesswith you and release the money to you as the next of kin to Mr. FORREST STEPHEN DeMARTINO for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will soon proceed for my retirement leave this year, and I personally do not want this fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.That is why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement from the banking services this year. The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer Mr. FORREST STEPHEN DeMARTINO was a foreigner and a Senigalise cannot stand as his next of kin or heir.in agreement that 40% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased, indicating your bank account number and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest, I will Guide you on the application that you will send to my Bank authority.This transaction is guaranteed to success withoutany problems.Looking forward to your urgent reply.Regards,Mr Martin Dele- Mr Martin Dele"

"                           STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIALYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't knowme personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MR.DAVIDKUBA,the first SON of MR.PEDRO KUBA,a farmer and leader movement forDemocratic change  (MDC)in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land disputein Zimbabwe.I was furnished with viable information from the International TradeCentre here in Johannesburg and I decided to  write to you. Before thedeath of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum ofUS$40 M(FOURTY  MILLION  UNITED STATES DOLLARS),in a Security Company, asif he fore saw the  looming danger in Zimbabwe.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals  forthe farms and the establishment of the new farms in Swaziland. This landproblem  came when Zimbabwean President MR.ROBERT MUGABE introduced a newLand Act which  wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blackfarmers.This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean warveterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact, alot of people have been killed because of this land reformed Actfor which my father was one of the victims.It is against this  background, that I and my family who are currentlystaying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's  money to foreignaccount since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker)to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction.As the eldest SON of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility ofseeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferredwithout the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everythingwe have got.I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money  in South Africa  for fear of going through the same experience  in future since bothcountries have similar political history. Moreover,the South  AfricanForeign Exchange policy  does  not allow such investment as an  asylumseeker. As a business man,whom I have entrusted my future and of my familyin his hands,I must let  you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family. will aid us in transferring themoney into any account you will nominate overseas.This money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you,firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money fornominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go intopartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money inyour country. Which ever the option you want, feel free to notify me as I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurredin the proccess of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of themoney while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with the above telephone number while I implore you to maintainthe absolute secrecy required in this transaction. And no matter the levelof transaction we are, you must call me on phone first before sending areply.Please, You should keep this transaction secret and confidential.

What's the reason from Lippert?
"FROM MR BARTHOLOMEW R MUTIE.Sir,I personally decided to put in writing as below, the full details of this business proposal that I have been trying to explain to you. I have a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$78M, which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and while 5% should be set side for reimbursement of any unforeseen expenses we both might incure in the cause of this transaction. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I am proposing to you.My name is Bartholomew mutie, I am the personal assistance to the former President of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles Taylor decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum.  Based on these developments, his various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings, President Charles Taylor was able, through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$78M, on my name as the owner to a private security company vault inNigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later, but resently he has just been arrested and taken away. you can read more on CNN news of March 30, 2006. http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/03/29/taylor.nigeria/index.html All the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my possession, What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks.My questions are:- 1. Can you handle this project? 2. Can I give you this trust? 3. can you keep this business as very confidential? 4. If you can sponsor this transfer, Is 25% acceptable to you, as your commission?REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS:Consider this and reply as soon as possible to (my private email address) mutbarth@infinito.it, so i can give you more clear explanations details and information about this transaction. I will also need your direct telephone and fax number for easy reach. Finally, it is my humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. Please i need you to send me your telephone number so i can give you a call immediately for more discusion. As soon as I get your positive response, I will send you more information to you.Best regardMr. Bartholomew mutie"

">From Mr. Thompson J. AlberDear Friend,  I sincerely hope that after you read this mail you will respond to my call, let me start by introducing myself my name is Thompson J. Alber. I am 70 years old, a British living in West Africa. I am a businessman and own two companies here in Ouagadougou, married with two children. My wife and two children died in a car accident six years ago but before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for I never really cared about other values in life but since the loss of my family, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families.   I have been helping orphans in motherless homes, I have donated some money to orphans in Sudan, America and some Asian countries. Before I became ill, I kept some money, Ten million,three hundred thousand dollars (US$10.3million) to be precise in a long term deposit account in a Bank.  Presently, I'm in a hospital my doctor told me I have prostate cancer that I have a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations. Because so much of my wealth has been plundered by relatives and friends since my illness, hence I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them since the money in the Bank is the last fund that I have left. Right now I am partially stranded in the hospital due to the nature of my sickness so I am appealing to you to help me collect the deposit from the Bank and distribute it amongst charity organizations.  I would want you to use your discretion to distribute the money and keep 20% of it for yourself. Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money for any cost you might have incurred during the process of collecting and distributing the money to charity organizations. May the good Lord bless you and your family. if you are interested to proceed with this project go ahead and forward the below information so that I will instruct you on how to proceed:Your Full Names:Your Direct Telephone Number:Your Fax:Your Occupation:Your Nationality:Your Age: Please reply to this mail as I can only communicate through my laptop which is by my bed, as soon as I get the above listed information, I shall then give you the necessary information you need to collect this money. God bless you. Mr. Thompson J. Alber."

Thank you Madame Secretary. Best from Beijing. Kurt
"Dear  friend,This letter must surprise you because we have never meet before neither inperson nor by correspondence, but I believe that it takes just one day to me=etor know someone either physically or through correspondence.I got your contact through my personal search, you were revealed as =20being quiteastute in private entrepreneurship, and one has no doubt in your ability tohandle a financial business transaction. I am Mr. Liu Yan a transfer =20supervisoroperations in investment section in Bank of China Ltd. Secretariat of =20the BOCHKCharitable Foundation 13/F. Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Hong =20Kong I havean obscured business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war =20our clientGeneral Mohammed Jassim Ali who work with the Iraqi forces and also =20business manmade a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Ninete=enmillion Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even early in the war. Againafter the war another notification was sent and still no response came =20from him.We later find out that General Mohammed Jassim Ali and his family had beenkilled during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home.After furtherinvestigation it was also discovered that General Mohammed Jassim Ali did no=tdeclare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of h=isbank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my =20office thatno one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Nineteen million FiveHundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and =20no one willever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that, according =20to the tothe laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to th=eownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as aforeigner to stand as the next of kin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali =20so that youwill be able to receive his funds.I want you to know that I have had =20everythingplanned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorn=eythat will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next o=fkin to General Mohammed Jassim Ali, all what is required from you at =20this stageis for you to provide me with your Full Names, private phone number =20and Addressso that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made =20the next ofkin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure thenecessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of t=hefunds to an account that will be provided by you with my guidiance.There is =norisk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized =20method andthe attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account w=eshall discuss the percentage issue on your reply.If you are interested pleas=esend me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address.Kind RegardsLiu Yan."
"At the moment, I'm very busy here because of theinvestment projects which I and my new partner arehaving at hand in FRANCE . Finally, remember thatI have forwarded instruction to the Lawyer on yourbehalf to send the bank cheque to you as soon as youcontact him without delay.Please I will like you toaccept this token with good faith as this is from thebottom of my heart.Thanks and God bless you and yourfamily. Hope to hear from you soon.Your brotherANTHONY  DILLIONEMAIL:anthonydillion001@yahoo.it"
I hope that you can read this (3 pages) before your meeting with Secretary Gates on pooled funding on Monday. I havespent a lot of time thinking about these issues in the context of the QDDR but I think if we're going to push the position Isuggest it has to be now. If you agree there are a number of ways we can make this quite attractive to other agencies aswell as DoD. AM

"Mr. Jun Cheng,Bank Of Korea,16-1, Yoido-dong, Youngdungpo-gu, Seoul 150-873.Dear Friend         I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the  foreign remittance  department of Hanivitbank. In my department, we  discovered an  abandoned sum of  $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire  family, on November  1997, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the  information about his death,  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.          Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.            Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2005, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.          The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.Personal Regards,Mr. Jun Cheng___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site- http://yoursite.com"

"Dear, By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. Trusting to hear from you, I remain Respectfully yours, Mr. Idris Umar. NB:FOR SECURITY REASONS PLEASE REVERT BACK TO ME VIA THIS MY ALTERNATIVE MAILBOX:(idrisumar71@rediffmail.com) FIND MY CELL NUMBERS 234 80 33338093. ___________________________________________________GO.com Mail                                    Get Your Free, Private E-mail at http://mail.go.com"

"Dear friend,As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I Believe Everyone will die someday. My name is JAIN HAGIS I am a merchant of Oman Nationality but presently residing in London. I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and Right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for Anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Oman, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to becontended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen million united state dollars $18,000,000 that I have with finance/Security Company in europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.mr. JAIN HAGISI will not want you to send me an email on this box. I will want you to send me an email on this box {jahagis3@myway.com}. This is because my brother saw me when I was sending this email to you and I will not want them to know that I am in contact with you.     __________________________________________________________________________________MailMN-Mongol Tumnii Email.

I was very fortune to meet the deceased file when i was arranging the old and abandoned customers files of 2000-2001 in other to submit to the bank managements accordingly for documentation purposes. Following our banking financial policy, it was obviously indicated and signed law fully that if such money remains unclaimed after five years without somebody been a foreigner apply and claim the fund as the next of kin , the money will be transferred into the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed fund.So the request of you as a foreigner is necessarily needed for the claim because a citizen of Burkina Faso cannot come forward to claim the fund since the law does not permit an indigene to claim such fund Since the real beneficary of the fund is died , the bank are expecting the next of kin to apply for the release of the fund for him or her without delay but unfortunately i learnt through the investigations which I carried out that there is nobody behind who can come and claim the fund.Therefore I want you to apply to the bank with your reliable bank account details where our bank will transfer the fund into and immediately the fund is transferred into your account ,i will share the fund according to the percentage indicated below.SIXTY PERCENT (60%) of the total fund will be for me.THIRTY PERCENT( 30%) for you in provision of the Bank account.FIVE PERCENT(5%) will be for unexpected expenses which may occur during the transfer.FIVE PERCENT(5%) will be preserved for helping the helpless people, like charity organization and motherless babies.Thereafter you will help me to visit your country for sharing the money according to the percentage indicated above.And for the immediate transfer of this fund into your bank account as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as the only existing next of kin to the deceased customer and after approval which will take place immediately as you applied, the transfer of the fund into your nominated bank account will proceed. Please note that you should keep this business secret until you confirm the transfer into the bank account which you will provide. And there is NO RISK in this business. The bank will forward to you all necessary documents related to the transfer and which will prove that you make a legal claim of inheritance.It is true that i pray to GOD before i was pushed forward to contact you for this business but i want you to assure me solemnly that you are a trsutwothy,reliable,honest and capable to avoid cheating me in this business.If you are really sure of your integerity, Reply immediatelly you receive this mail and call me on 00226 76 40 64 06  for more detailed information on how the process to transfer the fund into your account will be.Yours faithfully,Mr Raj Mohammed._________________________________________________________________Windows Live Mail : d�couvrez et testez la version b�ta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d"

" late Mr.Darby Assinga <BR>Taylor. who died last 3 years in the crisis in liberia, western Africa. My <BR>late father is&nbsp;an aide to exile president Charles Taylor, died as a result <BR>of uprising against his Government by rebel groups.</STRONG></DIV>  <DIV><STRONG>Meanwhile, before the death of my father he had taken me to Bangkok <BR>Thailand to deposit the sum of&nbsp;SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US <BR>Dollars ($7.5million US Dollars) in january 2001 at a Security Company. <BR>Initially, he intended investing this money in a garment factory in <BR>Bangkok, before the rebel forces assasinated him. This money was deposited <BR>as Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This <BR>money was part of millions of dollars the president mapped out for the <BR>purchase of <BR>ammunitions,militaryhard/softwares,light and heavy duty vehicles and <BR>other defensive logistics. My late father sensing the weakness of the <BR>ruling Government, he took me to Thailand in january to deposit the money <BR>in a private security company as family valuables of containing <BR>gemstones and financial documents.</STRONG></DIV>  <DIV><STRONG>As he returned from arms negotiation from eastern Europe, he was <BR>assasinated by the rebels forces on 11 april 2002 which prompted me to seek <BR>asylum in Thailand where the money and the whole documents are with me <BR>right now. This resulted to killing and mass action by the government <BR>and rebel soldiers. Infact, a lot of people have been killed and they are <BR>still killing uptill now because of this war of which my father was one <BR>of the victims. Perhaps, if you are conversant with world news you can <BR>understand me better.</STRONG></DIV>  <DIV><STRONG>It is against this background that I am soliciting need your assistance to <BR>help and provide a foreign account for us especially sourcing for <BR>reliable and trustworthy ventures where the money will be invested when <BR>transferred to your account in your country, Since the law of Thailand <BR>prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to operate a bank account or to be <BR>involved in any financial transaction.</STRONG></DIV>  <DIV><STRONG>I am in&nbsp; now saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine <BR>foreign account into which this money can be transferred without the <BR>knowledge of my home government who are bent on taking everything we have got.&nbsp;<BR>At the moment, We are faced with the dilemma of investing this <BR>amount of money in Thailand for fear of seizure or going through this same <BR>experience or seizure because of terrorist activitiesarcotics agencies.</STRONG></DIV>  <DIV><STRONG>I am soliciting your willingness to help me explore possible areas we <BR>can invest our money in your country.and in a profitable business I <BR>would equally appreciate your willingness to help me relocate my immediate <BR>family of three to your country where I will invest the fund.The cash is&nbsp;<BR>($7.5 MILLION US DOLLARS) means for the would-be project is under my <BR>custody. I will therefore appreciate it, if you can travel to meet with <BR>me in bangkok,Thailand, hence my permit (Refugee) only allows us to make <BR>a single trip out of the country gurranted asylum.Again to enable us <BR>have a memorandum of understanding, discuss on likely profitable and <BR>reliable ventures where the money will be invested in your country and and <BR>also promise you 20% per! cent of the total fund for your assistance and <BR>support in making the transfer a success. after the consignment is <BR>released from storage.</STRONG></DIV>  <DIV><STRONG>This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you <BR>accord me your unalloyed and due cooperation and willing to assist me, <BR>please reply me and include your private E-mail/fax and telephone <BR>number.

My relationship with Mr. Mark started in 1992 when I was a supervisor in first bank marina branch.We met in my social club annual end of the year party and I introduced him to my bank where he opened this account some few weeks later making me the account officer to the account and he operated this account until his death. On the 21st of April 2001, Mr. Mark, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along sagamu express road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries through your Embassy to locate any of Mr. Mark's extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by Mr. Mark before they get confiscated since the bank has decleared the account unserviceable.I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years since I was recalled back to marina branch as a senior manager from a transfer that took me to another branch of the bank. I therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased , so that the proceeds of this account valued at $18,723,822.90 can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you. I have access to necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. "

Here inNIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high reputewith years of outstanding service to the people ofAfrica.I have resolved to contact you through thismedium based on business proposal that will be ofmutual benefit to both of us.I got your particulars through a consultant companybase on my research for atrustworthy and establishedperson that understands investment ethic for enteringinto a life time profitable joint partnershipinvestment and also co-operation with confidence andtrust that you willkeep the contents secret anddivulged to any third party.To be explicit and straight to the point. Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of ours depositedaconsignment in our company\'s vault for safekeeping.And since then our client has failed to comeforward to claim his consignment, which hasaccumulated aconsiderable amount of money indemurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact thisclient to redeem the demurrage which his consignmenthad accumulated we discovered that our client was theformer president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, whodied of illness after he was de-throwed in the sameyear the consignment was entrusted into our care.Sincethe death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,none of his benefactors has come forward to claim theconsignment with us, which means that non of hisrelatives or aids had any knowledge of thisconsignment.Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open thetwo boxes that our client deposited in our vault. Andto my surprise I discovered that the two boxes thatwere registered as treasurer by our client actuallycontained a considerable amount of money in UnitedStates Dollars amounting to about US$30 millionDollar. Since this development I have been nursingplans secretly. I also found out from enquiries andthe foreign media that our late client siphoned a lotof money from his country while he was in office ashead of state.It is my conviction that the consignmentin our vault was part of the money that our clientsiphoned and now that he is dead there is no race tothis money in our care.I am now soliciting your nobleassistance to assist me in transferring this money outof nigeria to your country for immediate investmentwith your assistance.I have also decided that you willgenerously been titled to 30% of the total amount.Upon my receiptof your reply confirming yourwillingness to assist me of this transaction, I willimmediately arrange and transfer all the rights ofownership of this consignment to your name tofacilitate your easy clearance and transfer of thecomplete funds to yourcountry.you have nothing to worry about, as I will be thereto assist you in anyway necessary with all properdocumentation.This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintainabsolute confidentiality on this matter.Please reply to the above email address with yourtelephone and fax so can call you.Thanks.Yours faithfully.MR.ISA MUHAMEED__________________________________________________________________Get Tiscali Broadband From =A315:99http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadbandhome/"

However by virtue of our positions as civil servants in our country we cannot acquire this money directly, in our names. We are not allowed by the civil service code of conduct to own or operate bank account outside our shores, on the other hand it is not safe for us to keep the money here due to our unstable political environment in this part of the world. I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for an overseas silent partner in whose account we would transfer the us$18,500,000.00 to, for our mutual benefit, hence the reason for this email. I am requesting that you assist us as our silent partner and receive the funds in your account for us on trust. We propose to share as follows, 20% to you as commision and 80 for us.

"THE NBC/YORKERDecember 14 2010The EnvoyPosted by Hendrik HertzbergLast night as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party a friendapproached cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier she and I had been inside chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth ofa holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. ""Richard Holbrooke died"" she said.Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition damaged aorta emergency surgery—thissudden awful ending was a shock because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything abouthim was large: his physical size including the ultimate ""in your face"" face a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-sawvoice a highly expressive instrument equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth gossipy wisecrack often pleasingly nasty)and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience fordanger for praise for power for fun); and his ambitions (for himself for his beliefs for the United States for the world). Hewas no doe-eyed peacenik but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particularwars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality romantic about his own tough-guy realism.Unlike my tearful informant who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl I was acquainted with himin the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a ""source"" a prolific and forceful writer whosefavorite venues The New Republic and The New Yorker happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He wasgregarious and fond of big splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago on November 1st at theNew York Public Library's ""Literary Lions"" celebration. At the pre-dinner reception where he would normally have been onhis feet looming large he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife Kati Marton bring the party to him.At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do.Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars I asked himif he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song ""The Envoy."" He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. Afterthat he mentioned it every single time I've seen him up to and including that NYPL gala saying he puts it on loud when heneeds a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama and he liked it that way.If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000 then the Envoy almost certainly would have become theSecretary of State and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is Holbrooke has left a stronger morepositive more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a brokenheart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly impossible demands of his last impossible assignment thatbrought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to bethe most important he ever spoke.Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Getty ImagesRead morehttp://www. newyo rker. corn/on line/b log s/hend ri khe rtzberq/20 10/1 2/ho lb rooke. htm 1?p ri ntab le=true#ixzz1 8HjNL4kn"

POLITICS d.dby MARC AMBINDER« The Sunday Shows In Five Bullet Points I MainNov 29 2009 9:13 pm by Marc AmbinderA Last-Minute Meeting On AfghanistanPresident Obama convened a last-minute meeting of his national security team tonight to discuss the language that hisadministration will use to describe its new strategy for Afghanistan. Two administration sources confirmed that themeeting which began at 5:oo pm included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would notdescribe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggeststhat the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates toGen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the president's Tuesday speech.Before young officers at West Point Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skepticalnation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps andtimeframes. Obama is expected to announce that he'll order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about3000o troops in all most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistan's indigenous army. His speechas described in broad terms by advisers last week will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans thatthe war in Afghanistan is winnable as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believethat the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy hewould not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan which might run into oppositionfrom Democrats in Congress who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions onAfghanistan President Hamid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the thestability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan. An explanation that the American people would accept hasproven elusive.Permalink :: Comments (0) TrackBacks (0) :: Share

"See below. Will send PIR comments shortly.To: CDMFr: CaitlinRe: Branch BookOverview:There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises"" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pickup on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosedinformation about Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot ofthings that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring andmuch more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as ""and this day and the next day"" as My Lifeit does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact thatthere appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. FurthermoreWJC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection through his dictations that the number of direct WJCquotes was far fewer than I had expected.HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions withBranch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past with the exception of theGephardt comment and didn't grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC thoughtthat there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty muchaligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly or not surprisingly many of the problems discussed inthe book are those which face the current Administration—Middle East peace North Korea China etc...Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinionof the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example hisconnection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it) but there are some subjects that arestrikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising but it did notappear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic they just weren't addressed. Much like My Lifeone theme that repeated itself was WJC's conflict with and disdain for the media especially long passagesabout NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting but youwould be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally there are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and hischronic fatigue with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.The book has quite a bit on Whitewater but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branchcould write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friendslater quashed who slept over while HRC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch doesportray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacksWhitewater as a political hunt Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated fromWhitewater because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone's eye suchas WJC referring to Paula Jones as ""a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize.""Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce Bennett and Kendall noother lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into in which WJC says part of the reasonhe didn't mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time ifshe was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is avery small passage that could easily be missed but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing thisbefore. (This is addressed more fully below.)There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationshipwith Gore which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end and his contentious relationship withJanet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issuesare discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayedin a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period with ample mention of herrelationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC both pre- and post-impeachment.On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East Northern Ireland the BalkansChina Russia Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written aboutHaiti is about Branch's own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussionabout North Korea but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed inwhat seems to track mention of him in My Life which seems to have more detail and background than thisbook.In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that theUSSS cancelled one stop because they would be ""defenseless"" flying in whereas Brach writes that the streetswould be lined with ""assassins."" There are candid looks at WJC's take on certain people and the relationshipbetween some such as Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin'sdrinking such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.One thing to note is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recordersgoing but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC'sGephardt comment.The following items are addressed in the memo:Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4WJC and Lewinsky's Silence 4HRC and Kissinger 4HRC and gay/lesbian 5Tension with Moynihan 5HRC as World Player 5Jesse Jackson 6Tension with Janet Reno 6Portrayal of Carter 7Relationship with Gore 8Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta HRC and Haiti Invasion ITAV co-author flapSubpoenas of CVC's Friends Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex Gore/HRC ticket WJC suggesting Rubin runfor Senate Trip to South Asia) 11Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime BillIn discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strainedinterpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a ""confession."" My Lifeonly mentions Lee's accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages fromBranch's book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department after fierce debate among the securityagencies indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to hispersonal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail lockdownsolitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets toChina or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored theirtreason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him morethan to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch 577]➢ While Lee was indicted Branch writes that WJC noted that others ""were being held in secret unchargedand untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law withoutforeseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act any prosecutor should decide within thelegal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To hisdismay Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extremedetention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American. We accept guiltypeople on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.' [Branch 629]WJC and Lewinsky's SilenceBranch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it couldsend her to jail as she had denied it.➢ ""Also he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial ofthe affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship he said Starr couldhave turned him into a witness against Lewinsky betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties whileoriginal struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for hissteadfast denial nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky's account."" [Branch 511]HRC and KissingerThe following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling EleanorRoosevelt.➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where hecomplained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued tosay ""it was interesting in fact that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. Hisvisage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet announcing gladly that his worries were over becausethe Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh no Dr. Kissinger' she replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it'sdead. We'll keep fighting and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She said Kissing blanchedspeechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last in Hillary's dream it registered thathis strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed'Hillary repeated lost in thought. 'You know I always get my revenge in dreams but never in real life.'[Branch 179]HRC and gay/lesbianWriting about a call with HRC from NYS Branch recalls how WJC's counsel got very ""exercised."" WJC leftthe room. ""He was subdued on his return. 'You know I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my lifethan Hillary.' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative religious core formed before homosexual issueswere even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible and she was unsure what heat she could take.On the other hand personal experience could speed adaptation."" [Branch 551]Tension with MoynihanThere are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration withMoynihan. For example:> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia couldfight for themselves Branch writes ""The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just afreebie for him' snapped Clinton 'and he knows it.'"" [p.140]> In regard to health care: ""Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihanfor aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme."" [p.170]➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: ""She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats and quoted anumber of them. Senator Moynihan for instance publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he wassure they had nothing to hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihanskated blithely on the surface never produced results in Congress and could not withstand such scrutinyhimself for five minutes living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the PennsylvaniaAvenue Development Corporation."" [Brach 182]➢ ""Donnybrook"" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regrettedhypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press ""He doesn't understand...that he'sconceding the principles."" WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the pressand said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by ""feeding the beast of hostile presumption aboutClinton's motives."" [Branch 299]HRC as World PlayerThere are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage both with WJC and on her own. Severalexamples follow:➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: ""They had retreated for lunch as two couples—theClintons with the king and his wife Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was adelicate race between Hussein's failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The presidentsaid he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders waterdisputes travel barriers war grievances contested airspace sealed electrical grids and so on. Husseingave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point."" [Branch 170]> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995 ""Her [HRC's] schedule was far moredemanding than ceremonial pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtroddenwomen."" [Branch 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. ""By contrast witha superficial American press which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance inexotic Asia Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements forcitizenship groups and small-scale economic development."" (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds toa NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying ""she [HRC] played the traditional role of FirstLady as wife and mother..."") [Branch 246]> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how shedepicted the ""harsh reality everywhere"" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on therave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch 289]➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown Branch writes ""Yeltsin seemed so removed fromurgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly."" [Branch 512-513]Jesse JacksonBranch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contactwith her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCsgratitude but the fact that Jackson ""counseled"" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.➢ ""But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke he calledChelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it wasanother story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened inAmerican politics. He did not know everything involved but he wanted to remind Chelsea how muchher parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all and if she needed to counselrage or pray he was always available."" [Branch 497]Tension with Janet RenoThroughout the book from his nomination of her WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negativeopinion of Janet Reno.> ""He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear in fact that he felt alienated from his own attorneygeneral. If he removed her however the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996campaign finance] would fall to Reno's deputy Jamie Gorelick who Clinton feared may share Reno'swholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become atarget...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick to start fresh it would touch off a firestorm of protestlike Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.That was not an option."" [Branch 388-389]> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato andcontinuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her""desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit' the president said tersely. 'I didn'thire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'"" [Branch398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements includingcoordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewaterbut that ""he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since lettingmandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Renohad failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally but the institution—and by extensionthe entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered hermore naïve than upright and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her."" [Branch 399] He citesthat Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire secondterm.Portrayal of Jimmy CarterThere are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip toNorth Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to beon the front lines.North Korea:➢ ""On North Korea he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Goreand Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extremeisolation... Sure enough Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung who proposed to allowinspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official addinggratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White Houseseething but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of lettersand he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt.' [Branch162]Haiti:➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break withGore (who said Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission toHaiti to seek a truce with the junta Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis'(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States' best interest). Hedidn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea Carter again Carter went tothe press first. ""The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday and Carter invited to stayover at the White House called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the nextmorning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct the president said tersely was notright...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominentnegotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment toClinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president but Clintonfound this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference heallowed exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton Carter simply felt that he had earned the right tospeak his mind as an international statesman even about a mission he had accepted for the United Statesgovernment complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn butClinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident."" [Branch 200-201]Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq➢ ""He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent including former presidents Ford Reagan andBush. 'Dole will support me' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes but hedoesn't have much positive to say."" [Branch 518]GoreFor the majority of the book there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few placeswhere he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end however describes theseemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.➢ On page 92 Branch writes ""No he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy asalleged but to improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security AdviserTony Lake boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher and disorganized Defense Secretary LesAspin."" [Branch 92]➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and alsohaving Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as othernations were offended that Gore not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan toredeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January but WJC""pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.`Al' Clinton told him 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Goreerupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight said the president and were stillwrangling about dates for Japan."" Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC sawLewinsky. [Branch 316-317]➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore WJC et al working asa team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a secondcriminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30000 per month. The conversation isabout a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.➢ On Gore's announcing his campaign. ""The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for hiskickoff events—once from Geneva hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches weretechnical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himselffrom Clinton's personal flaws and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.'First it was true. Second it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third Gore would bebadgered to death until he did. 'Al' Clinton told him 'if you thought it would help in the campaign Iwould let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'"" [Branch 553-554]Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of hiscampaign. ""On tape the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and toGore's pollster Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood preciselyhow and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him offsubstance."" [Branch 554]➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout but it was always framed as his fear of Gore notsucceeding him. For example ""Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smartexperience and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidentialcharacter over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore ""stiff"" but Clinton discountedthis liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also wasperceived to be too conventional a Democrat therefore lacking independence which called for Gore toemphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a broodingquality about him not worrisome or off-putting in itself but potentially damaging if his serious naturefailed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word ""sunny."" Gore needed more of it."" [Branch 599]➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. ""Gore knew Washington. Believeme said the president his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years hadit not been for the vice president."" He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone whowould be a bright spot to run with perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey although he also goes intogreat detail about the virtues of Mikulski even though she would never get chosen. How much of thiswas WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch 599 618-19]➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. ""They should be runningessentially for a third term said the president but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record wouldtarnish them with Clinton's character."" [Branch 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debatethat had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where ""Gore had bared himself in oneof their stressful consultations by insisting that he Gore was a good politician elaborating that hemeant good on the policy and also good on the politics but admitted that he did not instinctively blendthe two. Gore said he had to think about it and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...Hehad the stuff to be a great president and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehowwithout seeming to brag on his own record."" [Branch 623-624]➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsureat first about recording the details. At the outset it says ""For his own part Gore was not angry nor didhe blame Clinton for his defeat but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around himdid."" [Branch 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore's use of him was proper—he was best in theWhite House. Then he says ""'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days'""Clinton told Gore 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your messagenow that we're being honest.'"" [Branch 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that""Clinton's drag plagued every direction."" Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance thanClinton and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush and that he was an ""unparalleled"" vicepresident but that he had ""blind spots."" Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was""surreal.""o Gore had a ""fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raisingscandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personalintegrity but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore saidhe had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However he remembered telling the president thathe found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And thepresident was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations fortrouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe theensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election or unhinged. 'I thoughthe was in Neverland' he said."" [Branch 643-644]o Branch continues: ""The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supportedClinton all through the impeachment publicly and privately while declaring himselfdisappointed. Yes said the president. He appreciated that. However persisted Gore Clinton didnot confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little tosay Clinton replied beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry had made mistake.He had misled the American people and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.Well he said this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a doubletake...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both ofthem angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so significanthere?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayedhonesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..."" [Branch644-45]Other➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life in Branch's book it has WJC askingMaggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. ""Williams was shrewd discreetand efficient."" [Branch 161]> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team'ssuggestion to invade Haiti. ""He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against thepressure the lack of options and his sense of being trapped she said he was badly served by his foreignpolicy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—LakeBerger and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby RayInman as defense secretary."" [Branch 189]> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator Barbara Feinman a friend of Quinn.HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draftchapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as aghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a femaleveterinarian of Socks' were ""discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House."" [Branch342-343]> Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato as Chair of the Banking Committee hadsubpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records werethere. This included ""some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers."" Senator Sarbanes quashed thesubpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch 362]➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky Branch says of Vernon Jordan ""In ourglancing associations I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described aslighthearted or recreational."" [Branch 495]> Gore/HRC ticket: ""By the numbers and Clinton's gut a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats theirbest chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down' he [WJC] said tut I don't think Alwould ever do it.'"" [Branch 540]> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supportingHRC if she decided to run which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether thetwo events are unconnected. ""When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win theNew York Senate seat Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now...""[Branch 557]➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh because ""of hardintelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins."" [Branch 594] My Life discussesthe cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.DI 'Gephardt is an asshole"" Hillary commented. The president pointing to my recorders advised gently that the tapes were on. Shewinced but shrugged with a smile. ""Well he is"" she insisted. In an awkward silence I backed up both machines to erase the firstlady's epithet."" [Branch 263]"

"HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONK KONG.Dear Sir, Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.  So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years and 10 months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Wang  Qin"

"Dear Friend,I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked ""Diplomatic Baggage"". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amountingto US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as ""Precious Stones and Jewellry"" in other that itscontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our accountcannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria tomove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries"" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.Expecting your response urgently.Best regards,Mr. Ben Suleman"

Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country~ US$ 152Million.3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 Million. The original values of this contract were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts has been fully paid and project officially commissioned. consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant and are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant Laws) from opening operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses (Internal & External) between the parties in the course of the transfer.

We have encouraged Allawi's Iraqiyya and Maliki's State of Law to see if they can worktogether because that reflects the votes and would give the new gov't a healthy majority. But who fills what position --that's for the Iraqis to decide.There may be other ways to have a gov't. But this should happen soon. Where we would have concerns: if the Sadristsend up with the power to veto gov't decisions or to topple the gov't.
"Snowe Supports Senate Ratification of NewSTART TreatyDecember 10 2010WASHINGTON D.C. — U.S. Senator Olympia). Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in support of Senateratification of the New START Treaty:""The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty known as New START was signed by the United States and Russia on April8th and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13th of this year. Since then the U.S. Senate hasheld 18 hearings and as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence I have worked with my colleagues toscrutinize this agreement and ensure any classified matters are properly vetted. Much has changed since the originalSTART was first negotiated in 1991 and as a result I have supported efforts to make certain that questions regarding ourability to verify Russian compliance with the Treaty's limits to develop and deploy effective missile defenses and tomodernize our nuclear weapons complex have been satisfactorily resolved.""I am confident that New START will provide predictability in our relationship with Russia and thus enhance globalstability and most importantly our national security. Therefore if the Majority moves to consider New START under aframework that allows for sufficient debate and amendments I intend to support the Resolution of Advice and Consent."""

"HANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG.Dear Sir, Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. S! o, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr. Wang  Qin___________________________________________________________________________Mail sent from WebMail service at BFMaps.com- http://www.bfmaps.com"

"sbwhoeopFriday April 23 2010 10:11 AMFYI Kornblum... SidIn light of Clegg's rising popularity partly based on his anti-Americanism and Germany's growing hegemony in Europewhile becoming more insular John Kornblum has written this op-ed with reference in last graphs to US policy.7.71April 23 2010I.H.T. Op-Ed ContributorGermany in Need of a DreamBy JOHN KORNBLUMHas Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is nolonger the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the FrauleinGermania of 2010 as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany myBlackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:Germany has changed very little but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945 but trauma remains a defining issue for Germansociety. Sixty five years later Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability respectability andpeace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solelywithin a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did notremove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany sometimes over the opposition ofothers — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushedthem with determination.Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a commoncurrency but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark for decades the European monetary standard. The eurostability pact now the object of so much controversy with Greece was the result. After 1990 the E.U.'s eastwardexpansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.Slowly and without fanfare Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the wayGermany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused byGermany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded inpursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his but it almost always left leadership to others.A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. ""Europe"" in the institutional sense has becomeincreasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the GermanConstitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance toGreece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German TeaParty?Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the ""motor of Europe."" Ms. Merkel'sunwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many it signified the decline of Germanwillingness to ""salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag"" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot but they happen to be the only ones whocan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption thatcharacterizes many E.U. programs.Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them the question iswhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so surethat its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to aglobalized world.And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not thatGermany is dangerous; even worse that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many otherswhen it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning toburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense ofcommon purpose the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselvesoften tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200000 of them were waiting to hear when theyrallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to ""Dare to Hope"" which is thecharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. Americaseems busy elsewhere.The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building ademocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting tohaggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big forGermany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works the United States will bejoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space within which modern democratic values will harnessmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will beassured.European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream andthe United States is too busy to try we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up itsside of the bargain Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.John Kornblum senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin served as the U.S. ambassador toGermany from 1997 to 2001."

"Marking a landmark moment for allDaily Herald Editorial BoardPublished: 8/26/2010 12:05 AMToday marks a watershed moment in our nation's history.Know what it is? Any plans to celebrate the occasion? Ninety years ago this day the United Statessecretary of state signed into law the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the rightto vote.That significant moment in history securing that basic civil right for one of the two genders inexistence came after a more than 70-year struggle that saw pioneering ""radical"" women jailed andphysically abused as they fought for justice.Ninety years ago today. Not all that long ago really. We still have women among us who lived duringa time when this basic but powerful activity was prohibited. Denied to their mothers andgrandmothers older sisters and aunts.Illinois played a pivotal role in the struggle and Illinois and suburban women continue to mark ourhistory politics and policy. And they should continue to by exercising their right speaking out andworking to change policies that affect us all.Illinois did not allow women to vote in presidential and local elections until 1913 and according tovotingwomen.org Illinois Michigan and Wisconsin were the first three states to ratify the 19thAmendment on June 10 1919.From the start Illinois and its suburbs have been home to pioneering women. Libertyville's ClaraColby is listed as the first woman to vote having cast a ballot for a new town hall while papers at thetime reported her husband stayed home to ""scrub clothes in the laundry.""There is Jane Addams the Cedarville III. native social worker and suffragist who founded Chicago'sHull House and was one of the first women to win a Nobel Peace Prize.And Illinois has elected 14 female members of Congress. The first was Chicago Republican WinnifredS. Huck only the third woman elected to Congress just two years after the 19th Amendmentratification. Huck was the first wife and mother elected to Congress. Republican Ruth HannaMcCormick worked as a Springfield lobbyist who helped pass the law allowing Illinois women to votein some elections in 1913 before she moved on to Congress. Democrat Emily Taft Douglas an earlyleader of the League of Women Voters and an internationalist who was the wife of former U.S. Sen.Paul Douglas and a cousin to President William H. Taft beat isolationist Republican Stephen Day in1945 according to the Women in Congress website.In more recent times Rockford Republican Lynn Martin moved from Congress to Labor Secretaryand Chicago Democrat Carol Moseley Braun became the first black woman in the U.S. Senate. Nowof course we also have Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who hails from Park Ridge. In the suburbantrenches all along the way women have been leading and agitating for change. Former Democraticstate Rep. Eugenia Chapman of Arlington Heights is credited with helping start community colleges inIllinois. Republican Giddy Dyer of Hinsdale joined her in supporting the Equal Rights Amendment andalso passed DuPage County's first clean air ordinance. Chapman worked with Republican Virginia B.Macdonald of Arlington Heights to establish a women's center at Harper College. And omit goes.Nice you say but big deal? Indeed they were a big deal and indeed women shaping our lives stillare a big deal. Men can you imagine your life without women? Women can you imagine your lifewithout other women? American women have come a long way in 90 years and society is the betterfor it. Women vote in greater numbers than men and have for years nationally and in Illinois. Theyvery well can and should vote write laws lead and play even more influential roles in what the next90 years and beyond may bring us all."

The rea=son for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human priv=ileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned o=f the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing ba=sed on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my= extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assistin=g me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the= auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'=Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard.=20=20I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very b=eneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investiga=tion and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum o=f money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horri=fic Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- ce=ntury tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia.=20=20>From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed h=im with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The pe=rson that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who =died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this in=formation secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and id=ea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amou=nt was (US$11.4M).=20=20Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bona=fide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer th=is money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and need=ed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest= and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great busi=ness opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this de=al alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we =are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an e=ye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.==20=20This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who =will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to t=he Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to b=e re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification a=nd clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole mo=ney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.=20=20May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I =have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you.

"The Washington PostDecember 4 2012 TuesdayRegional EditionSECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25HEADLINE: It's not about RiceBYLINE: Richard CohenBODY:In 1953 an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was aleftist possibly a communist and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy inWashington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism"" and he launched aninvestigation that transfixed the nation. Peress by the way was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of hisday.Rice of course is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador a friend of Barack Obama'sand a member of his Cabinet. Still the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of havingdone - just what was it exactly? - that as in the Peress case you have to conclude that there is something moreat work.At first I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing hisRumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemncharge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi Libya.She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was in fact a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others werewrong - or deceptive - then so inevitably was she.Just as surely as day follows night McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Itwas soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - apost to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully orincompetently misled the American public"" they bellowed.I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president and that matters a greatdeal. But she is also seen as overly political and that as much as her version of Benghazi is what troubles someothers. Oddly enough Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) a former presidential candidate and another potentialsecretary of state is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker whohas as in days of old restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee of which he ischairman.But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the WhiteHouse and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire and while she has done a commendableU.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739841Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.job at Foggy Bottom we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the mostpart she executed not initiated foreign policy.So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of uneaseabout Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government'salleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else(with the possible exception of the American Legion) Similarly Rice has become the personification ofunhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of anamorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding it lacks theme.Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might bedusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has becomebut much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread a refugeecalamity has developed 40000 people have died and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarnaadministration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.This sense of an aimless foreign policy one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives muchmore than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. Hesees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case forintervention not just say it's too hard to do.The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in thiscase the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to Americanpower not merely American politics.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739841Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

"Greetings from the beautiful land of Zimbabwe.I am Joseph Made of Lands, Agriculture, & Rural Resettlement ministry ofZimbabwe.As a member of cabinet and former stuanch supporter of President Mugabe'sgovernment I was opportuned to be in the know as to what led to thestruggle for farm lands and subsequent fall out of my government with theWestern world. As of today I would be more than glad if the case of whathappened can be reversed as I have come to see that it was all in pursuitof the selfish interest of one man, the president!After all said and done, it has become obvious that my president like anyother African leaders needed to make sure that he remains in power to notjust consolidate his fortunes but also to make sure that he bleeds thecountry to death by siphoning the money meant for developmentalinfrastrure abroad. Of course with the help of some foreigners who do notsee anythng wrong in helping him steal the country blind. I may very well be sounding like a disgruntled and dis-appointed personbut the truth is that he has shifted his gaze from the foreigners to hisown very people. He sees any suggestions or opinions that does not agreewith his own has been that of a sabortuer and the person therefore mustbe purnished. In other words, we the followers have come to realise thathe feels threatened by not just our presence but coupled with the factthat most of us are privy to what transpired and are very much aware ofthe movement of large sums of money abroad.As it stands now I and many others are of the strong opinion that sooneror later it will be our turn to be flushed out of the composition ofmembers of cabinet and replaced with loyals who obviously have sworn to a=noath of allegiance and loyalty via fetish and ritualistic methods. Thisbeing the norm does not appeal to some of us and therefore we are nowtargets to be dismissed/disgraced from service or face possibleextermination.I have contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with youthe possibility of placing some funds with you for management purposeeither in your existing establishment or other venture to be undertakenafter due delibrations and under terms to be agreed upon. I will prefersthat this investment be made in your country if and when we have arrivedat a compromise.I sincerely appologise for writing you via this means even without priorestablished acquaintance. But I do beleive that as we get along you willcome to understand the reason for my writing through this means.I thank you for taking time to read my letter and hope that you willrespond soon with any inquiries that may help you decide on your next lin=eof action.Regards,JM.My Secured Email Address:joseph_m333@latinmail.com"

The reported death toll has topped 150000 and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. How about startingwith a 700000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entitymakes a lot of sense.Haiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% ofthe population.Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopmentand accentuate political instability.Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere Haitian youth are a wellspringof creativity talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they arestifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities.Fortunately Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitutioncommits citizens to national service though it has never been activated. What is more there are many Haitian andinternational organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going.A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work.They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital but also could begin planting trees working the fields andproviding services in Haiti's countryside.At a minimum this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there.This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake 50% of youth in their 20s were outof work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring theirand their country's pride and dignity.A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the nextcrisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facingmonumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapiddisbursement transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferringcapital.Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from thebottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes international best practice recommends proposals that promote directmonetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalisticprograms that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards a civic service corps would circumventunnecessary administrative costs.Further a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During pastdecades the state provided relatively few services to Haitians particularly outside the capital. In some cases stateentities were downright predatory. As a result nonstate providers including gangs and shady middlemen filled the gap.A civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating thegovernment's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It wouldbe a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people.A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path ofhurricanes and on a fault line and can expect more disasters. Training 700000 young people -- especially young women-- in the basics of first aid emergency response community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate theconsequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management the corps could provide more intensivetraining in specialized areas -- engineering telecommunications and public health.An initial step to getting Haiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haitiincluding the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluableexperiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmentalorganization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited andtrained hundreds of Haitian youth including former gang members to provide relief services in Haiti's slums. Thisprogram could be reactivated and scaled up quickly.A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for say up to two years.The Haitian government would of course need to be the one to manage the undertaking with direct oversight from thepresident's office and the Interior Ministry.And there are many countries that could provide advice and support.Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essentialskills.Haiti's youth are the future of the nation and they are central to Haiti's recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scaleway to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long-term progressive changes.Robert Muggah based at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva is a principal ofthe SecDev Group and is currently advising multilateral and bilateral organizations on Haiti's recovery.

"Dear beloved,My name is Abdul Manoni, A Bahrain national,I have been diagnosed withOesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment,and right now I have only about a few months to live, according tomedical experts. I have not particularly  lived my life so well,as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was alwayshostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the onlything I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that thereismore to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in theworld. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to thisworld I wouldlive my life a different way from how I have lived it.Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as afew close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soulso, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I wantthis to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I haveDistributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somaliaand Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot dothis myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one ofmy accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to becontended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which noone knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen Milliondollars($18,000,000,00) that I have with a finance Houseabroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and despatch itto charity organizations.N/B:KINDLY NOTE THAT 20% of this funds must go to the tsunamivictims and another 10% for your effort and time.Regards.Abdul Manoni"

"BANK OF AMERICA (ASIA)LTD.17/F DEVCON HOUSE979 KING'S ROADHONG KONG.Dear Friend,I am Joseph Wong, credit officer of Bank of America (Asia) Ltd, Hong Kong.I  have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you.On october 6, 2001, an American Engineer/Consultant with  the ChineseSolid  Minerals Corporation,Mr. Steinmetz Horst made a (Fixed) Deposit fortwelve calendar months, valued at US$40,500,000.00 (Forty Million  FiveHundred thousand United State Dollars only) in my branch.Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address butgot no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discoveredfrom his contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporationthat Mr. Steinmetz Horst died from a recurrent heart disease.On further investigation,I found out that he died  without making  a will,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. SteinmetzHorst did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  officialdocuments, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$40,500,000.00 is still lingering in my Bank and theinterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of eachyear. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign and defenseaffairs,at the expiration of 5 (five) years,such funds will revert to theownership of the chinese Government for financing military operations,suchas purchasing of arms and ammunitions for the military.In order to avert this negative development,i will like to seek for yourpermission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. SteinmetzHorst so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use forfinancing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in theworld in general.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of60% for me and 30% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course ofthe transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for thisproject will be done by my attorney and with my position as the creditofficer guarantees the successful execution of this project. If you areinterested,please reply immediately.Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and thatwill help you understand the transaction.You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this project would be most profitable for both parties because I shall requireyour assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply.Thanks and regards.Mr. Joseph Wong."

"sbwhoeopTuesday April 13 2010 6:35 PMH: If this poll holds Labour has a majority. 1st debate thu. Sid• Print this pageFrom Times OnlineApril 14 2010Tory lead narrows amid huge voterdisenchantment Times poll findsolmage :1 of 20Peter RiddellThe general election race is tightening according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep publicdisenchantment with the campaign so far.The poll undertaken yesterday and this morning says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than eithera Tory or a Labour outright victory.Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent while Labour is a point up at 33 percent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent.The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way. and these shifts are within the margin of error of the average.With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its manifestolaunch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today.If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time and there is a uniform switch in votesLabour would be the largest single party with about 300 MPs ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. Thiswould point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing.The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one)against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour thanthe Tories in a hung parliament by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they wantLabour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government.The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the pastweek. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament at 33 per cent down six points compared with aweek ago. Overall 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be.The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely honestabout their tax plans 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about cutting thedeficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the extent to whichthey can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest.Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducingthe increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools hospitalsand the police (the Tories not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign workersemployed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour).In only one case the £150-a-year tax break did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party makingthe proposal.In most cases the pledge will make little difference to people's votes apart from three made by Labour: the foreignworkers language pledge doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools hospitals etc.More than two fifths (43 per cent) including 50 per cent of women say ""none of the parties"" or ""don't know"" when askedwhich party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and 18 percent Labour.Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders' debate on Thursday evening. Men andmiddle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect DavidCameron to win the debate against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57 percent) expect their leader to win.Two fifths of the public (42 per cent up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour but are not surethat it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent down one point think it is time for a change to theTories.Populus interviewed a random sample of 1525 adult voters on April 12 to 13. Interviews were conducted across thecountry and have been weighted to be representative of all adults.

"By way of introduction I am Eng. Farouk Al-Bashar, I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family, who are the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground, where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America.We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here.We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam.I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be successful, we would then come over to your countryfor a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner.For your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation.We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.Regards.Eng. Farouk Al- BasharFor the entire Al-Bashar family"
Thanks so much -- for your leadership and friendship and for the opportunity to be part of this great team.All best.Jack

GelbA diplomat under fire.With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom commentators were desperatelysearching for news preferably a new victim to brighten their days. And along came SusanRice. A couple Sundays ago the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talkshows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi Libya was ""spontaneous""rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was aMormon.Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneousevent. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled keyintelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice wasjust covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeedHillary Clinton as secretary of State.The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to thewall. Peter King the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representativespledged to ""investigate"" and hold hearings. And that said the commentariat would be theend of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739637Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.Now let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts such as they are. Rice didnot make up the ""spontaneous"" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intelreports told the very story Rice repeated publicly i.e. that the Benghazi mob formed moreor less on its own mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslimfigures and that extremists then took advantage to kill including Ambassador ChristopherStevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with theinevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers madethe same error and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what theintelligence briefers told me but I knew very well that more and contradictory informationwould appear soon enough. It always does.Sure the CIA had additional intel from the start but it hadn't begun to sift through all thecommunications intercepts satellite photos and human reports. It always takes time to sortout facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly this gossamer information isnow taking shape.Meantime Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom along withSenator John Kerry NSC Adviser Tom Donilon and former diplomat Nicholas Burns nowof Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd and he still likesher despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears though flatlyinaccurate won't help her either. What will help her and more importantly a flaggingObama after the first debate is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.U.S. Department of StateCase No. F-2015-04841Doc No. C05739637Date: 05/13/2015STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

"Dear friend, l am Dr Mallam Galadima., the contracts verification manager of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Because of my position and that of other strategic officials who are heads in their Departments, we have in our possession, since 2001 the sum of US$400M Dolllars (Four hundred million United States Dollars) which we emassed through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully executed and commissioned with the different foreign contractors duely paid their full contract amounts.We have made several fruitless moves to transfer this fund abroad for our mutual benefits. One in 2002 when one Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States of America, living at No 125 N. Kinsley Ave. Ocean City, NJ 082216, ran away with our US$65M Dollars after the fund has been transfered into his account. lt was unbelievable, shocking and hypertensive that when we went there to claim our share of the fund, we were told that nobody with that name was living in that house and that the former occupant of the flat moved away few weeks ago to an unkown house. This is how we lost US$65M Dollars to the heartless Mr. Lambert Brown. The second attempt was when in 2003, we decided to carry US$50M dollars in cash through the Lagos lnternational Airport but was stopped by the Nigerian Custom Officers who seized the fund till date . This is how we lost another US$50M Dollars to the Nigerian Custom. Following the peaceful life ushered in by the current democratic dispensation in Nigeria, l and my colleages have decided to transfer the sum of US$22M (Twenty Two Million dollars) into a foreign account operated by a foreigner for our mutual benefits. By this letter, l request your assistance in transferring and safeguarding the sum of US$22M Dollars for our mutual benefits. For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum 5% will be set aside for charity and philantropic purposes 57% belongs to me and my colleagues while 3% will go for reimbursement of all expenses made by both parties. However, l want you to be human and humane so that you do not become this second Mr. Lambert Brown of the United States. lt is imperative to note that this transaction is risk free as all modalities for the successful transfer of this fund have been perfected by my colleagues in the relevant ministries. However, we should see absolute confidentiality as our watchword throughout the course of this transaction for we are civil servants and will equally not like the 2002 event to redramatise itself. l will not be ungrateful if you can urgently furnish me with your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers and name of beneficiary with the telex numbers of the receiving bank. These will enable us speed up the claim of the fund and eventual transfer into your nominated account. Please reply via this alternative email address:mallamgaladima59@yahoo.com Looking forward to hear from you soonest. Dr.Mallam Galadima"

"Good Day,With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hopethis letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising  to you toreceive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My nameis  Owen Mubane, the first son of Mapele Mubane, of the  most popularblack farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in mycountry. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you  through email,after searching  for contacts via the internet, as it  is the only meansI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties  with Zimbabwe forsecurity and safety reasons.  However, I apologize  if this is notacceptable to you.The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  abusiness venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabwe,as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of  new Land ActReform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich blackfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,  my father for sawthe danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was  murdered, he withdrewall of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our sharesin major companies. We then went to  SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum ofUS$14.5 million  (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars),in a private  security company. This money was deposited with thisPrivate Security  company for safety and security reasons, and  was tobe used for the  purchase of land, new machines and chemicalsestablishment of new  farms in Europe.President Mugabe's support for the violent  Zimbabwean war veterans  andsome lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  fatherand other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon myinheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for awhile, but when the danger became unbearable, and I  survived two murderattempts, I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the Netherlandswhere I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come hereto seek asylum, is  because the security company from South Africa, hasa branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office inJohannesburg down  here. I need to transfer this money to  an accountand invest part of  the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits arefugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any =financialtransaction, this is why  I am seeking a genuine and reliable  partner,whose account this money can be transferred, hence this  proposal toyou.You have to understand that this decision taken by me  entrusts myfuture and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping  of thismoney. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for  me, is toassist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security companyfrom their office here in The Netherlands, as it has  now beentransfered from Johannesburg, South Afri!  ca to their branch here. Thecompany will be legally informed of you  representing me.For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you canchoose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping meopen an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go  intopartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  moneyin your country. Whichever the option you want, please to  notify me inyour reply.  I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for allkinds of  expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction,and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10%for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in theaccount here for me.Please, I want you maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  ofthis transaction.  I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and Ithank you in  advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach meon my  direct line which is 31 617 562  914 or via emailowenmubane1000@rediffmail.com.

Just saw the WaPo article w your photo and wondered whether that was on your list?
"I am Engr; Abubakar Saeed, the director of works FMW&H Nigeria and chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of ultinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H). The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$9.6,000,000.00 (Nine million six hundred united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the Central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction  the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary.Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by  you sending me a mail through my confidential email address so that I can brief you further (abu_saeed04@tiscali.co.uk).I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our home work properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service,which we intend to retire from.  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the first quarter payments for the 2004 financial year.Thanks and God bless.Engr; Abubakar Saeed."

"FROM THE DESK OF MR. JOHN EDWARD.BANK OF AFRICA( B.O.A)OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICAN.Dear Friend,I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of  bank of africa( B.O.A).In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$30m dollars (THIRTY MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account that belongs to one of our foreigncustomer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with his entire family in November 2000 in a plane crash. FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THIS SITE BELOWhttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stmSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for itas next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking gildings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money toyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the banktreasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. Therequest of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% willbe set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicatedTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application .I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours Faithfully,MR.

"Pinstripes to cargo pants -- Clinton tailors newvision for diplomacyBy Elise Labatt CNNOctober 27 2010 12:51 p.m. EDTSTORY HIGHLIGHTS• It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Department• Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power• Going forward diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy anddevelopment ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks.In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy andDevelopment Review commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review the first-ever such an undertaking for theState Department is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects theirstrategy and priorities.The new approach to development Clinton says will focus on American leadership through civilian power. BothClinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about ""demilitarizing"" foreign policy and Clintonsays the QDDR will suggest how to do that with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and developmentmuch of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis.In the article Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document which she called a blueprint for reforms to beimplemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S.government agencies creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring thatdevelopment undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and ""sustainable"" impact.""Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty and expanding and strengthening middle classes around theworld will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States'national security strategy"" Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development wasto ""put itself out of business"" by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future.President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United NationsGeneral Assembly when he released the ""U.S. Global Development Policy"" which changes U.S. efforts to focus onbuilding up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential.But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detaileverything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy how the United States undertakes""stabilization"" efforts in post-conflict areas how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to thetypes and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach.American diplomats going forward Clinton said are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit."

Avant sa mort nous �tionstous les deux chr�tien veritable.A sa mort que j'ai d�cid� de ne pas me remarier ou obtenirun enfant en dehors de ma maison matrimoniale chose quedefend la bible.Du vivant de mon d�funt mari, il a d�pos�la somme de 3.5 Millions $ americain(Trois millions cinqcents mille Dollars americain) dans une Masion de securit� en palce ici en C�te d'Ivoire.Actuellement, cet argent est toujours avec labanque.R�cemment, mon docteur m'a inform� du fait que jesouffrirais d'une maladie s�rieuse: le cancer.

Apr�s avoir su mon�tat j'ai d�cid� de donner ce fonds � une �glise ou � unepersonne qui utilisera cet argent tel que je l'instruirais.Je recherche donc une �glise ou une personne de confiancequi mettra ces fonds aux services des orphelinats, veuves,propageant ainsi la parole de Dieu et faire en sorte quel'oeuvre de Dieu soit maintenue. La bible declare qu'estb�nie la main qui donne.J'ai pris cette d�cision parce que je n'ai aucun enfant quipourrait h�riter de cet argent et les parents de mon marine sont pas chr�tiens.je ne veux pas que les efforts de monmari soient dilapid�s par des non-croyants. Je ne veux nonplus une situation o� cet argent sera employ� dans leschoses du monde;raison pour laquelle je prends cetted�cision. Je ne craint point la mort par cons�quent que jesais o� je vais. Je sais que je vais �tre dans le royaumedu seigneur. Exode 14 verset 14 dit :""le seigneur d�fendrama cause et je demeurerai dans sa paix"".D�s que je re�ois votre r�ponse je vous enverrais lecontact de la maison de securit� ici � abidjan. Je joindrai�galement une lettre d'autorit� qui vous prouvera que jesuis le b�n�ficiaire actuel de cet argent dansun caisse bien depos� comment l'effects famliaux pour laraison de prudence. Je veux que vous et votre �glise priieztoujours pour moi parce que le seigneur soit toujours monberger.Mon bonheur est que j'ai v�cu une vie de digne chr�tien.Celui qui veut servir le seigneur doit le servir dansl'esprit et la v�rit�. Veuillez demeurer toujours dans lapri�re toute votre vie.veuillez me rassurer que vous agirez en cons�quence commeje l'ai �voqu� ci-haut. Tout en esp�rerant recevoir votrer�ponse que Dieu vous benisse.Actuellement, je reside dans un hotel d'abidjan en C�ted'Ivoire.V�tre soeur en Christ,Mme Mari Gomogo."

I am presently in distress and under house arrestwhile my son Mohammed is undergoing trial in Lagos and Abuja though he has just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some amount of money.

"FROM MISS MARIA DENISEADDRESS/ AVE 11 RUE 45ABIDJAN COTE D IVOIREDearest BelovedBase on your profile i am happy to request for your assistance and alsoto go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you. I am  MISS maria denise,20years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS denise My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2003.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special.Before his death on Febuary 12 2003 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was decleared as family valuables personal for security reasons. I am just 20years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask you these question:-(1.) Can I completely trust you?Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.Thank you so much.My sincere regards,MISS maria denise.- maria denise"

"Dear,I am Dr.T. Erick, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 15% of the $26,.5 million, 80% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.Yours faithfully,Dr.T. Erick"

"Gaza: it's Hamas's move nowHamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel's occupation of Palestine••c) Jeremy Greenstocko quardian.co.uk Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BSTSo it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland with barely a load of buildingmaterials allowed in since then Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and if laws have been broken those responsible must beheld to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has toprevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt whatever theemotions behind all this.Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force forthe proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating atraumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. Theyare also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground.The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza John Ging gave a speech in London this week entitled ""Illegal inhuman. andinsane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010"". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israelthe only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end come to risk any claim tointernational legitimacy in its handling of this situation?Hamas are the enemy of Israel but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily yet over the past17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectlyperhaps but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gazabombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006and claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present Hamas security people are being sniped at by theIsraeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine in both the WestBank and Gaza is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own directexperience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without thethreat of violence and that they would enter in good faith if that were reciprocated into negotiations to establish twostates in the disputed territories Israel and Palestine with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.The distortion of their position a little of it the fault of their own PR does no side any good.If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end theblockade is within reach if only Israel Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated thatthey could cease all attacks on Israeli soil close the tunnels release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza ifthe blockade was ended an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation while the relationship between Fatah inthe West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN the US Russia the EU and the Arab world must make amuch more serious attempt to test the possibilities putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first not their own politicalcomfort.We are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy based on a West-Bank-only approach islocked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel isconfident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political diplomatic legal and moral high ground. This matters in today'sworld as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq because government authority and public opinion interact closely andlegitimacy breeds support.Israel's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyondthe west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier or controlling a one-state structure with part ofits population downgraded or imprisoned it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.I hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They have so far for a political organisation attractedmuch too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner they mustunequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence —underline that their objective is a two-state settlement and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. Inwhoever's hands bombs bullets rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will.•This article was originally written for the Times but not published"

"Dear Friend,I apologize if the contents in this mail are contrary to your moral ethics, which I feel may be of great disturbance to your personal life, But please treat with absolute secrecy and personal. I pray that this email reaches you in the best of health.I am Mrs will dera ahmed, born melika diouf, banking profession, mother of three childrenthe manager of bill and  exchange at the foreign remittance department Bank Of Africa. In my  department we discoveredan  abandoned sum of US$14.5M (fourteen million five  hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our  foreign customer who died along with his family in the 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have  been expecting his next of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless   some body applies for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guide lines and lawsbut  unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died  alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now  decided to make this business  proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation  to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is  coming for it and we don't want this  money to  go  into the bank treasury as   unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that  if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank  treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner  as next of kin in this  business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer  was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 45% of this money will be for you as  respect to the provision of a foreign account , 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the  business and 50% be for me.Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this  fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the  bank as relation or  next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account  number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effectivecommunication and location where the money will be  transfer.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by  fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your  notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you  receive this mail,Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours faithfully.Mrs MELIKA DIOUF,"

I have a time sensitive matter to discuss re Guantanamo detainees and Bermuda.
" This very confidential request should not come as a surprise to you. I am LUCY LOKOMBOH, the wife of the late L.T. Col. KABONGO LOKOMBOH, who was the Chief Security Officer to the late President Laurent Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo, with regards to your trustworthiness and reliability, I decided to seek for your assistance in transferring some money out of South Africa into your country, for onward dispatch and investment. I will reveal to you, based on the fact that I could rely on you, the height of the crisis that led to Laurent Kabila assassination, he personally mandated and instructed my husband to create and fully equip special elite force, to protect him against the rebels then, working against his government. This instruction was very discreet and highly confidential and was backed up with the sum of US$18.000, 000.00 (Eighteen million United States Dollars) in cash, for the purchase of Arms and Ammunition from an independent arms dealer in Republic of South Africa. We brought this fund to South Africa, where he was supposed to negotiate and purchase the Arms and Ammunition. This money was transported through diplomatic means, and negotiation was still in progress when the news came to me that our President has been shot. He then quickly decided to stop all negotiations and diverted the all funds to our personal use, as it was golden opportunity. He then left the children and me and went back home to attend the funeral of Laurent Kabila where he was also killed. This money is presently deposited in a Security Company here in Johannesburg, South Africa since January 2001 although the Security Company does not know the real content of the box. We deposited it as family treasure containing Gold and Diamond. I now seek your assistance in providing an overseas account to enable me transfer this money out of South Africa, to where it can be invested. I have made all the necessary arrangement on our own side to ensure smooth remittance. However, due to my refugee status I cannot operate a bank account here, neither can I invest here in South Africa. Hence my desire is to transfer and invest in your country. Please note that your account has got to be in a position to carry that amount of money. For your assistance, after the transaction, I have agreed to give you 15% of the total sum, while the balance of 85% will be for my investment. I intend to keep my presence here in South Africa low profile due to my popularity back home, so I request all information provided to be kept secret and confidential. I am obliged to provide details immediately as soon as I receive the "

"Dear Sir/Madam, compliments of the day. i got your email address from the south African on line network without wasting your time let me go straight to the point. In my department we discovered sum of $20million Us dollars(Twenty-million Us dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late MR.THOMPSON MORRIS Age 61 an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight261 which crashed on January- 31- 2000, including his wife and only daughter. Since we got information about his death,we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learned that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury asunclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed funds. We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me. Note this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this email you should contact me through my e-mail address. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you as has been finalized. HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON. YOURS, LAWSON MNANDI. EMAIL:lawmnandi@yahoo.it"

I am a highly placed official of the Government of Nigeria and also a founding member of the PEOPLES DEMOCRATAIC PARTY (PDP),which is the ruling party in Power now, in this Country. My committee - The Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC)-which is in charge of managing and supervising the development of the Oil rich states in this Country. We are given Monthly allocation that runs into several millions of DOLLARS/POUNDS from oil sales of this Country to cover payments of foreign and local contractors who has/is executing contracts for this oil region called the NIGER DELTA. My self and other colleagues in this commission, NDDC are currently in need of a foreign partner with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of Forty Nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars($49.5m).This fund was accrued from various over invoicing of contracts awarded to foreign contractors over the existing years of this commission. However, by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we cannot acquire this funds in our name. This is because as top civil servants, we are not allowed by law of the land to own or operate bank accounts outside our country for now therefore, I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues,to look for an oversea trusted partner in whose account we would transfer the fund Hence the reason for this mail.

"Attention !Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you. I got your contact information from your country's informationdirectory during my desperate search for someone who can assist mesecretly and confidentially in relocating and managing my funds. I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to its esteeming nature and a trust-worthy person that I can do business with . I must not hesitate to confine in you for this simple and sincere business.I am Mrs Hilda  P. Tomson, the legal wife of the chief securityofficer to late major Tomson  Page, My Husband was the former headof the presidential guard to Mr Charles Taylor the liberia president.Before the death of my Husband, on may 15th,2003 during an attemptby the rebels on the life of president C.Taylor, where he was brutally injured and subsequently rushed to the presidential hospital in monrovia where he later died.Before his death,he secretly called me to his bedside and told me that he has the sum of US$17Million dollars (Seventeen million dollars)which he deposited with my name as his legal wife as the beneficiary and next of kin in depositing the fund with a clearing house in European country. The major reason is that the fund was deposited in a Security Company in Europe it was because of the ways the president was ruling the country,that he foresee things might go wrong with him in due course. I am now in cotonou-Republic of Benin as a refugee because i am being sought after by the rebels since my husband was seen as one of Taylor's strong men as they want to wipe out our family. In this respect,i am humbly seeking your assistance in the following ways :1.To present yourselve as my beneficiary and next of kin tothe fund,since i am hiding my identity from the authority toavoid them confisticating the fund or sending it back to Liberia.2.To serve as a trustee to the fund.3.To make arrangement for me to come over to your country as aninvestor and to secure Residence permit in your country."

"Dearest one.   I will like to put a proposal to you. i am not by in any way compelling you.Brief information about myself.  I am the only Daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.rich. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.  It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad on the 12th September 2004. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle ofhis who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 6yrs old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on September 2004, he called me and informed me that he has the sum of Nine Million, Seven Hundred thousand United StateDollars.(USD$9,700,000.00)left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks in Africa. He further told me that he deposited the money in my name, and also gave me all the necessary but legal documents to this fund with the bank.I am just 20 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds and after the transaction I will come and reside permanently in your country till such a time that it will be convinient for me to return back home if I so desire. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessantpolitical crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want to invest the fund under your care because I am ignorant of business world.I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?2. Can I completely trust you?3. What percentage of the total amount in questionwill be good for you after the money is in youraccount? Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Immedaitely I confirm your willingness, I will also inform you more details involved in this matter.Kind Regards,Miss linda rich __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?

"I, on behalf of my other colleagues from differentorgans of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) ownedparastatals decided to solicit your assistance asregards transfer of the above-mentioned amount intoyour bank account.  This fund accrued from overinvoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatalto certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago.We, as holders of sensitive position in our variousparastatals, were mandated by the Federal Governmentto Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreignContractors and we discovered that some of thecontracts they executed were grossly over-invoicedeither by omission or commission.  In the process thesum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only)was found lying in the parastatal suspense accountafter the foreign contractors had been paid theirrightful dues for executing the said contracts.We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount betransferred (for our own use) into a bank accountprovided by a foreign partner, because we aregovernment workers and the Code of Conduct does notallow us to operate foreign accounts.However, we have succeeded in transferring some ofthis money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollarsonly) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (NorthAfrica), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO isup to some mischief and refuses to comply to theearlier mutual agreement by insisting that the totalamount be paid into his nominated bank account beforedisbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum ofUS$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are notcompensated, is it when the balance of US$22M(Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that wewill be sure of our full compensation? Of course, thisabuse of trust and inhumanity calls for soberreflection and search for absolute trust.Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance thatthe remaining amount of US$22M can be speedilyprocessed and fully remitted into your nominated bankaccount.  On successful remittance of the fund intoyour account, you will be compensated with 30% of theamount for your assistance and services.So far, much have been said and due to our sensitivepositions, we cannot afford a slip in this transactionneither can we give out identity as regards ourrespective offices, but whereby cordial relationshipis established, smooth operations commences, you willbe furnished with details of all you deserves to know.I am at your disposition to entertain any questionfrom you with respect to this transaction, so contactme immediately through my e:mail for furtherinformation on the requirements and procedure for thistransaction.Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality andutmost urgency.Yours faithfully,MR FRED OBI."

"By way of introduction I am Eng. Farouk Al-Bashar, I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family, who are the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground, where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America.We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here.We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam.I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be successful, we would then come over to your countryfor a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner.For your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation.We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.Regards.Eng. Farouk Al- BasharFor the entire Al-Bashar family"

"Corporate Tel.:+27-839494291mrs_mabo@latinmail.comSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal,though I don't know you and we had never meant in person but I got yourcontact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports.More so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in suchbusiness but you are in a better position to handle thetransaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with ourown share of fund once your account is credited within 4 -5 working daysbecause before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respectof this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal/essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. And the keyfor us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both partiesinvolved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contractpayment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I trulyapologize for using this means to reach you because I have no otherchoice.Within the South African Football Association and the cooperationof my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totalingEighteen Million Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,3M). Withyour assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague begyou to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presentlylying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It doesmatter whether it is a cooperate or personal account but as long as theaccount is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very okto us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the SouthAfrica Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operateoffshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to wardsthe successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall bothbenefits from. This US$18.3M arose from the balance of the total contractvalue for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg andSoweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it wasawarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president MRNelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which wethe officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract costhave been fully paid to the original contractor.  I have the authority ofmy partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us(which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sumwill be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall providefor the funds to be transferred into, 70% for us and 5% for taxation andmiscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your partprovided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also yourarea of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution ofthis transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that youwill not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistancewe shall invest in property management/real estate business in yourcountry. And that is why we  offered you 25% of the total amount not justto receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred toyour account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life Ihave been a civil servant."

Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground should we be explicit in asserting thatthis speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights?The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more heretoo. For example in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment etc.In the section about supporting individual defenders should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremonyhonoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I wasasked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention mightliterally save her life.Look forward to further discussion later today.

"77 Seaside Cottages Fish Hoek-Cape TownSouth Africa.  I feel quite safe dealing with you in this importantbusiness having gone through your remarkable profileon the internet. Though, this medium Internet) hasbeen greatly abused, I choose to reach you through itbecause it still remains the fastest medium ofcommunication.My name is Mr.Mandla Sizwe, I am the operationalmanager in account management section in charge ofcredit and foreign bills of one of the prime bankshere in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with hiswhole families on 18TH JULY 2003 in KENYAN PLANE CRASHwith the whole passengers aboard.There is an account opened in this bank in the year2000 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died withouta written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account.Since his death, I personally have watched with keeninterest to see the next of kin but all has provedabortive as no one has come to claim his funds and noother person knows about this account or anythingconcerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.The banking ethics here does not allow such money tostay more than six years without claim hence the moneywill be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy.I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate.It can be an EMTY account. On thisnote, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be ransferred for immediate investment but my only worry is the security of the fund once the fund is transfered into your account.It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder which I will provide to you if you are interested.This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.The total amount involved is $16,000,000.00 USD.[Sixteen Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance of &10 million to your account.At the conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 25% of the total transfer sum, 70% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer.If you are truly serious to do this business with me,and you know that you will never, ever betray me now or in the future let me know so that I will give you the full transaction details.Let me hear from you.Respectfully yours,Mr.Mandla Sizwe."

He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates. That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of mychoice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose such as real estate management or hotel management.Sir/madam I am honourably seeking your assistance in thefollowing ways.  1) To serve as a guardian of this fund since I am only 21years old  2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure aresident permit for me in your country.

"Madam SecretaryJake mentioned that you would like to see a copy of John Podesta's recent interview with the Financial Times. Atranscript of the interview has not been posted yet but I have included here the Financial Times article about theinterview. Please just let me know if you would like any further information on this.BestMikeFormer aide urges Obama to regain 'political narrative'By Edward Luce in WashingtonPublished: February 15 2010Barack Obama US president has lost control of the political narrative and needs to make more use of his cabinet inorder to regain it says John Podesta the man who headed the president's transition team.""My friends in the White House would agree with this that they lost the narrative"" Mr Podesta said in an interview forView from DC the Financial Times' video series from Washington. ""Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: itneeds I think to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president but by his entire team ... He's got a terrificcabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it.""Mr Podesta who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his firsttwo years which culminated in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform.When asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral""massacre"" for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in November he said: ""I subscribe to that view.""Mr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress Washington's largest liberal think-tank which was oftendescribed as a ""government-in-exile"" during the years George W. Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama hadthree options with healthcare reform. First try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation processwhich would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in aelection defeat in Massachusetts.The second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support The third would be to abandon the attemptas Mr Clinton did in 1993.Mr Podesta whom Mr Obama still regularly consults said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reformthrough. ""The worst option among the three is doing nothing and so they're going to have to figure out which track isviable"" he said. ""It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such then so be it.""He painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. ""It sucks"" he said. Pointing to a strategy ofobstructionism by Republican lawmakers he said: ""I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans butquite frankly he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.""The growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threateningto turn the US into ""in essence a parliamentary system without majority rule"" where the opposition automaticallyopposes any serious initiatives.The political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole he said. Since the 1978 passage ofProposition 13 in the state all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. ""And so nothing gets done.""Michael H.

"Dear Sir,My name is Hartman Onowu,I am the operational managerin account management section incharge of credit andforeign bills of one of the prime banks here in SouthAfrica. I am writing in respect of a foreign customerof my bank who perished with his whole families on25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ]with the whole passengers aboard.There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 bythis great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without awritten or oral WILL attatched to the account. Sincehis death , I personally has watched with keeninterest to see the next of kin but all has provedabortive as no one has come to claim his funds and noother person knows about this account or anythingconcerning it,the account has no other beneficiary anduntil his death he was the manager of his company.The total amount involved is 16,000,000.00USD.[Sixteen Million United States Dollar ]. We wishto start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Sixmillion] and open successful transaction without anydisappointment from your side, we shall re-apply forthe transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with the generalmanager of the bank who I must involve in order tohave a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund toany foreign bank account which you are going tonominate. On this note, I decided to seek for areliable foreigner who will act as the foreignbeneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providinghis/her bank account where the fund will betransferred for immediate investment on any viableproject as no one has come up to be the next of kin.The banking ethics here does not allow such money tostay more than six years without claim hence the moneywill be recalled to the government treasury asunclaimed after this long period of domancy. In viewof this I got your contact through my personal searchto see if you can assist by providing your safe bankaccount for the transfer or find a reliable person whowill be capable of receiving such amount in his or herpersonal account.At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fundwill be for me, I will give you 20% of the totaltransfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and inyour country while the remaining 5% will be set asideto settle expenses both parties might incure duringthe transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply,I will send to you a detailed information about thetransaction.I will not fail to bring to your noticethat this business is 100% risk and trouble free andthat you should not entertain any fear as allmodalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as thebeneficiary of the fund from the deceased.When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mailor you can call me or fax me. You should also includeyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safecommunication.TEL:870-763-648313   :870-763-648314.FAX:870-763-648315.

The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kgof C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint GeorgeHotel in the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to{http://www.hariri.info}.After in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or Aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out ofcuriosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client depositedin our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box thatwere registered as treasures by our client actually  contained aconsiderable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting toabout US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have beennursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and theforeign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from hiscountry while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my convictionthat the consignment in our vault was part of the money that ourclient siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to thismoney in our care. After going through his (WILL) I Found that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).Finally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assistme in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country forimmediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously beentitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your replyconfirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I Will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance andtransfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment.This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absoluteconfidentiality on this matter. Please reply on my private mail(jackkhumalo@sify.com)I await your most promptresponse.Yours faithfully,Mr. Jackson khumalo"

" Pardon me if I have offended you by contacting you for such a big transaction through an ordinary letter which makes it suspicious considering the type of fraud proposals moving around the world today.  However, I was advised to explain this transaction to you on a face to face meeting. I could not do this because of the situation in the world today not being sure of your reaction. I am Jones Martin, a Consultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese Businessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company in Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for termination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and the oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid payment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of US Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  A special arrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with Japanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to terminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with an arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they prepared and handed over to The banker. I was directly involved, well paid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was withdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault delivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection. The real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was delivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for the storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys were all handed over to me. Mr. Takashi the Florida businessman was planning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when the unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster which claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me devastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit details to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change which was signed was still with the banker in his office which was lost.Since last December the diplomatic storage manager has been calling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection. Since then, I have been finding any reliable person to collect these consignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came across your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been well organized, 100% safe, legal, and should be kept very confidential. Signify your interest by getting back to me via my email as soon as possible. Regard,Jones Martin"

"From:Mike RossmanE-MAIL:mikefamily11@netscape.netTEL:27 73 268 8646To err is human they say and to forgive is divine; but how do you start to forgive the killers of your younger brother if you do not know who the faceless persons are and if you are still living in fear of them?I am Mike, Simba Rossman's son; I'm a student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa where my two brothers and I were schooling; In line with the prevailing festive seasons, I feel it is not out of order to wish you and yours a happy festive season and God's blessings and abundance in this year.My younger brother was was pushed in front of an oncoming train that crushed the life out of his young body.We know he was murdered because my other brother and I have also had attempts made on our lives twice now and we have told our father about it.Kindly allow me digress a little bit, I am not telling you all of this to scare you please, I made my mind over and decided to write to you after having given much thought to our situation; My Father Dr. Simba Rossman, was the former Minister of Finance and Economic Development in Zimbabwe under the Government of Mugabe, his so called policies were not too popular with the other zombie-like cronies of our so-called president who openly questioned his loyalty to Mugabe. That was when the problems all started, he got death threats from people we did not know but suspected to be party loyalists, his car was burnt on one occasion when we were on a visit in Zimbabwe last year. The police did not even bother trying to investigate the matter; Mugabe finally removed him for openly and honestly declaring to the world that Zimbabwe faced a major and crippling food crisis at the height of the state-sponsored illegal land invasions.My younger brother varnished from our flat in Cape Town one afternoon and his body was found drugged and battered and all through his life he never smoked a stick of cigarette, not even a stimulant. It was obvious that die-hard supporters of Mugabe murdered him to spite or break my father's spirit, for my father loved him the most like we did. This brings me back to why I write you; I write to solicit for your help. My father was a successful businessman before he was called to serve in Mugabe's cabinet and he had business interests all over Africa, over here in South Africa our family has US$14.7 Million held in trust on our behalf by a Holden Agency, this was made possible by our father years ago with the help of his advisor who runs a finance company based here in South Africa. According to my father, the deposit was not made in his name but in the name of a company that was registered by him and leaving room for another partner with 82% controlling shares in the business; then the business was registered both in South Africa and in Zimbabwe, so that no one can claim that he was the owner of the money. My father cannot travel down to South Africa as he is being watched by agents of the state back home, he consulted with his advisor who is in South Africa and came up with this idea to help claim the funds and ferry my brother and I out of South Africa to a place of relative safety like the United States or England where we can continue with either schooling or working."

" Dear Friend,     Compliment of the season to you and your family. My name is MAYILVAHINI  MURUGAJYAN  CASARATE  Indian by origin and Ivorian citizen by marriage abduction. I want you to read this mail very carefully with and open mind, and may God bless you as you are following it up on humanitarian basis.    I am an India woman who got married to a military General in Ivorian Army. Late Gen. LAJA CASARATE. who died of rescent in November 24th 2005,  in a military hospital although some of his colleagues and friends said he was killed by a witch craft from his family.   I have only One son, with my late husband and whose name is BONNE CASARATE, my main aim of writing you this message is that immediately the Doctor announced that my late husband has given up, his so called brothers came and drove me and my son out of the house and lock up the place. And they claimed that my late husband has a second wife that had two children for him before he got married to me.     They insisted that me and my son should go back to India and stay till the family would decide on the sharing of our property. This was a very big shock to me that almost damged my health, i can not go back to India because my parents refused me to marry my late husband initially. But as a young lady that was in love, i had to run away from India with my late husband down to Abidjan- Cote d' ivoire when he was a Captain in 1987. Then my husband led an Ivorian Military troupe on a mission to India.    It is true that my parents collected money from a rich family in India, who  wanted me to get married to their son. I had to run away to my late husband in Abidjan - Cote d' ivoire, until this year January 20th when i travelled to india, everyone disowned me, no one wanted to talk to me.   Few months ago, my husband brought one box into the house and told me that the box was  seized from the rebel in Bouake, and he opened the box in my presence, which was full of United States Dollars, he told me that the box contained USD20million and we both went to keep it somewhere. His plans was to use the money to contest for the forthcoming presidential election in 2006 before his death. None of his family member is aware of this fund except myself and my son Bonne.    I am hereby seeking your advice and your assistance on how to get this funds out of this country and also want to seek advice if there is any profitable business that i can invest this money on in your country.       Please kindly keep this confidential and may God bless.   Best regards,  MAYILVAHINI  MURUGAJYAN CASARATE.		---------------------------------Have a question? Yahoo! Canada Answers. Go to Yahoo!

"Dear Friend,My name is MR EMMANUL BRIGGS. I am a staff of CITIBANK NA, LAGOS-NIGERIAin Africa with our head office in USA. I work in the operations deptwhere I serve as account officer to numerous customers. One of thecustomers whom I worked as his account officer was a wealthy diamondmerchandise. He lost his family, a wife and two children in a planecrash.Because this man was good to me when he was alive, I took it upon myselflast month, to search if I could locate any of his close relations. Butmy efforts were abortive so I did not present any official report of myfindings to the bank.Now there are two things I could do with regards to the dead mans money.First, as his accounts officer, I could formally notify the bankauthorities that the man is dead and has no next of kin. In this casethe money would be forfeited to the government treasury. As a matter offact this is the proper thing I am supposed to do.Another thing I can do is to arrange for someone else, a foreigner, toact as the next of kin to the late man so that he will claim the money. This is the option that I can do to help anybody and myself since themoney actually is now a public fund due to the fact that my friend was aclose ally to the late brutal military president that looted governmenttreasury and that is why I have chosen to do it. I want you to be mypartner in this deal. I will be investing most of my share into realestate business.All you would have to do is act as the next of kin of the dead man andthe whole money in the account will be transferred to your account afterdue process. As the accounts officer to the late man, I have certificate of thedeposit of the fund here our custody and I will also through a localattorney that I will hire, secure all the necessarydocuments that will empower you legally to claim the money from theaccount. The funds will be paid to you as inheritance money.The total deposit made in the account is USD10.5 million. We shalldiscuss and agree further on the percentage sharing ratio for both of usand this will be drafted and seal with an agreement letter on black andwhite that will bind both of us and guarantee our shares. Note that upon completion of the legal paper work that will make thedeal legitimate for you to claim the money as the next of Kin here, thefinal transfer will be made to your authorize bank account through ourcorrespondent bank in America (CITIBANK FSB MIAMI FOLRIDA or CITIBANKLONDON).All the approved documents and the wiring instructions will be fax toyou for your documentation and to enable you approach your bank forconfirmation.

"Corporate Tel.:+27-839494291mrs_mabo@latinmail.comSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.=20I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal,though I don't know you and we had never meant in person but I got yourcontact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports.More so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in suchbusiness but you are in a better position to handle thetransaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with ourown share of fund once your account is credited within 4 -5 working daysbecause before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respectof this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal/essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. And the ke=yfor us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both partiesinvolved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contractpayment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I trulyapologize for using this means to reach you because I have no otherchoice.Within the South African Football Association and the cooperationof my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totalin=gEighteen Million Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,3M). Withyour assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague begyou to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presentlylying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It doesmatter whether it is a cooperate or personal account but as long as theaccount is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very okto us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the SouthAfrica Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operateoffshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to ward=sthe successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall bothbenefits from. This US$18.3M arose from the balance of the total contractvalue for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg andSoweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it wa=sawarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president MRNelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which w=ethe officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract costhave been fully paid to the original contractor.  I have the authority ofmy partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us(which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sumwill be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall provid=efor the funds to be transferred into, 70% for us and 5% for taxation andmiscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your partprovided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also yourarea of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution ofthis transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that youwill not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistanc=ewe shall invest in property management/real estate business in yourcountry. And that is why we  offered you 25% of the total amount not justto receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred toyour account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life Ihave been a civil servant."
Thx to all.

"Dear Sir,  I am Mrs Aminat Mohamed  from Liberia, presently staying in Germany. I am married to Mr. Hassan Mohamed who worked with Liberian embassy in Lome-Togo for Ten years before he died in the year 2002.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief  illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Moslim. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Quran is against. When my late husband was  alive he deposited the sum of $6.8Million (Six Million Eight hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep this fund in Europe. I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, idows,propagating the word of Allah and to endeavor that the house of Allah is maintained. The Holy Quran made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision  because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Moslim and I don't want my husbands efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the  bosom of the Almighty Allah .I don't need any telephone  Communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the security company in Europe that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment you will need to go and claim this fund in Europe. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the organization to always pray for me  because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Moslim. Whoever that wants to serve the Allah must serve  him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your  life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person  for this same  purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.  Hoping to receive your reply and  Remain blessed in the Allah.. Yours in Allah ,Mrs Aminat Mohamed"

"engage in business discussions with our Private Banking ServicesDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I madenumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chiefoperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especiallygiven the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met onnumerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however Iencouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. Thefavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternativeinvestments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around variousopportunities and made attractive margins for our first months ofoperation, the accrued profit with interest included, stood at this pointat over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the fullpotential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns oninvestments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated because heneeded to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. Hedirected that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm inEurope.I informed him that our bank would have to make specialarrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process,the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater forbanking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but latercame around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he wasasking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strictsince the incidents of 9/11.I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainlandEurope, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his preciseinstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a securityconsultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that acceptsdeposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations thathandle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediateaccess to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiarespecially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In linewith instructions, the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the moneythere in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This wasthe last communication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002.In June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us ofthe inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astoundingposition as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed theprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, andI could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.Imade futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task oflocating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Fourdays later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparentlydead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heartattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather moreinformation and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediatelylaunched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alertabout the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If youare familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize ourservices usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment fromconventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. Inthe field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one willknow of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositorsuse numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also givesthe choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at thebank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as Isaid, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apartfrom not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills inour care, in this case; he died in testate.In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passedaway, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine whoshould have right to claim the estate, this investigation for severalmonths were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our privateinvestigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It isthis investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contactdetails and contact you, being as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as apotential benefactor of the estate even if you are in no way affiliatedwith this individual (the deceased).My official capacity dictates that Iam the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party toreceive the results of the investigation. What this means, with you beinga foreigner, I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow diedwith no known or identifiable family member.This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what theprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the latebeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by theend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim toour bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revertthe deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money entering ourbank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and outof the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I havemy way.What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but Iwant you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the bankingworld who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards forthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; youshould have begun by now to put together the general direction of what Ipropose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I alone have the depositdetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct themto do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as thefinance firm is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customerconcluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactionsin relation to the file are just customer services and due process. Thefinance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of thedeposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit toany party that comes forward, and this is the situation.This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family ofthe deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no familybut however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; I amprepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm torelease the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt"
"Dear Sir or Madam:We are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:I. Background:Shengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp.

And we hope we could have good cooperation in future.For additional information regarding this project, please feel free to contact us.Looking forward to your prompt reply.Sincerely yours, Tony LeungProject officer"
"Good day, This email message requires your utmost confidentiality. It is with warm heart I am offering you my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. I know this is a most unusual way to contact you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, but I am humbly asking that you take due consideration of the importance of my proposal and the immense benefit in it for you. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my intensive and desperate search for a partner, hence this email to you. I crave your indulgence to read this carefully, in order to have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried UNITA with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose Dembo and assume leadership in order to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my Uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in the war. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came her! e (Holland) to seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a Private Security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the safety deposit containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland to seek for political asylum here, is the location of the Security Company here in Amsterdam. Since President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and he has already done this in Angola, I cannot lodge the funds in my name any where in the world at the moment. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here on arrival last year. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that this kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is to act on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, since I can not participate in any business activity or open a bank account here as a political asylum seeker. After the safety deposit is claimed, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit and the release codes of the vaults for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you. This transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.

"FYI —POLITICOBoehner chief of staff dies at 46By: Patrick O'ConnorJanuary 10 2010 01:40 PM ESTPaula Nowakowski the longtime chief of staff to House Republican Leader John Boehnerdied unexpectedly Saturday night according to the leader's office. She was 46.""It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowskimy longtime chief of staff trusted aide and friend who died suddenly last night"" Boehnersaid in a statement early Sunday afternoon. ""Words cannot adequately express the sorrowand disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with today in the wake of thisstunning news.""A Boehner aide said the cause was an apparent heart attack.President Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were among those whocalled Boehner Sunday to offer their condolences on Nowakoski's death.""The entire Capitol Hill community is shocked and saddened by the sudden passing ofPaula Nowakowski"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""As Chief of Staff to Republican LeaderJohn Boehner Paula earned the respect not only of her Leadership and Conference butall House Members on both sides of the aisle. She served Leader Boehner both in hiscurrent position as well as previously at the Committee on Education and the Workforcewith great distinction.""Paula was a thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructiveand bipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently. Onbehalf of the entire House I express our deep sadness to Paula's family friends and ourcolleague Leader John Boehner.""""Paula had some of the finest qualities a public servant can have: she was committed toadvancing the cause of freedom she cared deeply about the people she served and shewas a patriot"" said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY.).""On behalf of her senate colleagues I pass on my condolences to her family LeaderBoehner and his staff and the whole House family for this tragic loss of our friend.""It would be hard to overstate Nowakowski's role in Boehner's tight-knit office. She hasworked for the Ohio Republican almost continuously since 1995 when she joined his staffas communications director for the Republican Conference.In the years since she has worked as staff director for the Education and LaborCommittee and served as his chief of staff since he returned to the leadership in early2006. She briefly left Boehner's side in 1998 after he lost the conference post following atough election for Republicans but rejoined him in 2001 when he assumed thechairmanship of the Education and Labor Committee.Along the way she counseled Boehner on just about every decision he made and oftenserved as an enforcer of sorts for the collegial Republican leader. It would be hard to findany chief of staff on Capitol Hill who maintained a closer relationship with her boss thanthe one she shared with Boehner.Aides said Sunday that Boehner's office and extended network of former colleaguesknown to many as ""Boehner-land"" were collectively shocked by the news.""We will remember Paula as she would want to be remembered — as a tireless workerfaithful friend rabid Detroit sports fan whip-smart strategist warrior for freedom anddevoted Catholic who counted President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II amongher greatest heroes. She will never be replaced or forgotten"" Boehner said. ""I ask for yourprayers for Paula's family.""©2009Capitol News Company LLCFD HIDDEN DIVTmt Washington ostNEWS! POLITICS I OPINIONS!

President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent.Romney Huckabee Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when Republicanvoters are asked who they prefer for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination the independent Quinnipiac(KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.Democratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party'snomination in 2012.""The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election buthis weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain"" said PeterA. Brown assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.""The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term isa roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men 34percent of whites 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deservesfour more years in the Oval Office.""In trial heats for 2012 former Massachusetts Gov. Romney receives 45 percent to 44 percent for Obama whilethe president gets 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Matched against Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels avirtual unknown to most voters the president leads 45 - 36 percent.""At this point former Alaska Gov. Palin runs the worst against President Obama. Daniels is essentially ageneric Republican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while hegets 48 percent against Ms. Palin"" said Brown. ""She is very unpopular among independents and although sherecently said she thought she could defeat Obama the data does not now necessarily support that assertion.""""Unlike Daniels who is a political unknown to most Americans virtually all voters have formed an opinionabout Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy.""Ms. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible Republican candidates in 2012.She is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents the keyswing voting bloc she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating.Huckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score.

Tim Pawlenty at 6percent and Daniels Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each.""The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point theRepublicans don't have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters""said Brown.From November 8 - 15 Quinnipiac University surveyed 2424 registered voters nationwide live by telephonewith a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.The Quinnipiac University Poll directed by Douglas Schwartz Ph.D. conducts public opinion surveys inPennsylvania New York New Jersey Connecticut Florida Ohio and the nation as a public service and forresearch.

"Corporate Tel.:+27-839494291mrs_mabo@latinmail.comSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.=20I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal,though I don't know you and we had never meant in person but I got yourcontact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports.More so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in suchbusiness but you are in a better position to handle thetransaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with ourown share of fund once your account is credited within 4 -5 working daysbecause before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respectof this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal/essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. And the ke=yfor us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both partiesinvolved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contractpayment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I trulyapologize for using this means to reach you because I have no otherchoice.Within the South African Football Association and the cooperationof my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totalin=gEighteen Million Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,3M). Withyour assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague begyou to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presentlylying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It doesmatter whether it is a cooperate or personal account but as long as theaccount is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very okto us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the SouthAfrica Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operateoffshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to ward=sthe successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall bothbenefits from. This US$18.3M arose from the balance of the total contractvalue for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg andSoweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it wa=sawarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president MRNelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which w=ethe officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract costhave been fully paid to the original contractor.  I have the authority ofmy partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us(which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sumwill be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall provid=efor the funds to be transferred into, 70% for us and 5% for taxation andmiscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your partprovided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also yourarea of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution ofthis transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that youwill not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistanc=ewe shall invest in property management/real estate business in yourcountry. And that is why we  offered you 25% of the total amount not justto receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred toyour account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life Ihave been a civil servant."

Firstly, I am LILLIAN DAMBA the wife of Late MR.K.DAMBA who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South African Trade and Business Information services and I assure you that nobody knows about this transaction except me, my two sons. Before the death of my Husband. He took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$15 Million (FIFYTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) in a private Security Company, when He foresees the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited as family valuables to avoid much demurrage cost from the Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of a new farm in Swaziland. The land disputes started when Zimbabwean President MR. ROBERT MUGABE introduced a new Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to many killings by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society.In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my husband was one of the victims. It is on this background that My family and I,who are currently staying in South Africa as refugees decided to transfer my Husband�s money to a foreign country since the laws of South Africa prohibits refugees from opening any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zones of South Africa. Please, I need your assistance to transfer this fund to your trusted overseas bank account. For your efforts and assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total sum, while 5% is mapped out to re-imbrues all the expenses incurred in the course of this transaction and 65% will be for my family investment in your country. Note that this transaction is 100% clear and Risk-Free, as I have made every necessary arrangement for a successful deal. The only thing I solicit for is your total assistance to transfer this money, complete trust and assurance that my own part of money will be safe when transferred to your account. Kindly keep this business proposal highly confidential for security reasons. If you are interested in assisting me,send reply via the above email address or fax no and include your private phone and fax no. I will respond to you immediately.   Looking forward to your urgent reply,   Thanks and God Bless. Sincerely yours, Lillian Damba (For The Family__________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

FYI — today the SFRC will take up at its business meeting the State Dept authorization bill. We have beenworking with them for months on this package and they have taken virtually all of our provisions intact. There are a few problems (minor) that we will continue to work on those but all in all it is a goodpackage. Unfortunately it will never become enacted so it is largely a symbolic gesture but it is helpfulnonetheless. Thought Kerry or Lugar might mention it to you and our general posture has been to thankthem for their efforts.

"READ MY MESSAGEI know that this mail will come to you as a surprise, I am HANSON MILLS,the manager, bill and exchange department, HSBC BANK Rye Lane Branch London UKIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 800,000.00 POUNDS (EIGHT Hundred Thousand POUNDS) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers(ROBERT  GANDESBERY,), who died along with his entire family on Monday, 31 July, 2000 in a plane crash in Paris. Please visit this site for the story linehttp:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stmSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin/relations  to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you, and for you to act as the next of kin to enable us release the money to you. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.We have agreed that 30% of this money will be for you for all the assistance and commitment you will put in to the transaction 10% will be set aside for all expenses incurred during the business and 50% would be for me.

"Kindly accept my apology for sending my mail to you. I am a true God fearing person, and I want you to trust me and help me out in this my condition. I believe you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country in the Internet.

Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted inthe web sites below:(I)http://www.usatoday.comews/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htmBefore my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5 million through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company Abroad.

"Dear Friend,My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to Live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my Life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all these as I now know that there are more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my Life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $20,500,000.00(Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 15% for you, then 5% for any expenses insured.God be with you.SALIM IBRAHIM"

"DEAR BELOVED,I am Sussan AdamsPLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above namedperson. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I?m now in NigerianGeneral HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embas=syin LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were =20married foreleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted foronly four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since h=isdeath I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial homewhich the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (TenMillion five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this =20money isstill under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently, =20my Doctortold me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancerproblems.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decid=edto donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individu=alThat will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want =achurch that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widowspropagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintaine=d.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I tookthis decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money an=dmy husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hardearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where th=ismoney will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bo=lddecision.I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am goi=ngto be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will figh=tmy case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication =inthis regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband'srelatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development=.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forwardyour personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address, =20with Yourtelephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the leg=alowner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into yournominated Bank Account in your country.I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as =20the realnext of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and =20the churchto always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise =methat you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. Myhappiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants t=oserve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerfu=lall through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serchingfor a church or Christian individual for this same purpose.

"Just saw the email from Sid - was working on the below report. Shaun apparently had a muchmore pessimistic view of what Cameron would do than all of our Parliament watchers who feltconfident from the get-go that he would support the deal.PM Brown praised all parties involved; stressed the need to adhere to the dates laid out inthe agreement several times; welcomed the supportive Westminster interventions during the Qand A of SDLP Mark Durkan and DUP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dods but pointedly expressed hopethat other parties (read UUP whose MP was either not present or simply didn't speak) wouldexpress their support as soon as possible.As expected David Cameron praised the agreement and all parties; raised the desire that allparties (read SDLP and UUP) be given time to review the document; and pointedly asked the PMwhat issues that were not expressly mentioned in the agreement would be addressed by theWorking Group -- to which Brown responded ""all the issues outstanding from St Andrew's.""Cameron and Brown praised the U.S. role singling you out. Brown also twice referred to youroffer to host an investment conference.Overall nothing concerning from the Tories...on the contrary full support a request thatthe minority parties have a chance to review and some questions on outstanding issues.UUP MLAs meet tonight to review.Note: DUP interventions were balanced.. .Dods raised parades and decommissioning as reminderof outstanding issues but stressed desire of all parties ""not to go back"" to the bad olddays. Minor dig at previous Sinn Fein ""threats."" Robinson stressed cooperation in thenegotiations. Struck a statesmanlike tone."

"Dear Beloveth,I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri Bolkiah,former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the GulfIsland.I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history,which  has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother,the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billiondollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office.However my father was kept under house arrest, his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the  sultanate.Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that I was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending you this mail.Before my In-castration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five Hundred Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under special arrangement  into the custody of different Private security and Trustee company s for safe keeping abroad."

"MANCHESTER (WA) 20515  Greetings,  As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry forme, because I believe everyone will die someday.  Myname is Mr.CAMPBELL WILLIAM, from NEW ZEALAND, I havebeen diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which wasdiscovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying formy health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, andright now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts.  I have since lost my power of speech and can onlymanage to write now, as that has been the only way Iam able to communicate. I have not particularly livedmy life so well, as I never really cared for anyonenot even myself but my business. Though I am veryrich, I was never generous, I was always hostile topeople and only focus on my business as that is theonly thing I cared for  But now I regret all this as I now know that there ismore to life than just wanting to have or make all themoney in the world. I believe when God gives me asecond chance to come to this world I would live mylife a different way from how I have lived it. Nowthat I know my time is near, I have willed and givenmost of my properties and assets to my immediate andextended family members and as well as a few closefriends.  I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul andso, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I did on earth. So far, I have distributedmoney to some charity organizations in UK, Brazil andIreland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this my self any more. I once askedmembers of my family to close one of my accounts anddonate the money, which I have there to charityorganization in Bulgaria and South Africa, theyrefused and kept the money to themselves.  Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem notto be contented with what I have left for them. Thelast of my money which only few of them knows of isthe huge cash deposit that I have with my Bank inABIDJAN. I will want you to help me collect thisdeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.waiting for reply.

"Secretary ClintonThank you! Will update you when I hear from her and if there is anything else I should do let me know. Allbest Jackieps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today. Fyi he is one of my favorite Singaporeansbecause of this 2007 speech on China which he posted to his blog (!):April 12 2007Foreign Minister George Yeo's speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on 5February 2007 which he gave off-the-cuff.Thank you Kishore for your kind words. Dear friends ladies and gentlemen. I was in India two weeks ago hada good trip spent nine days there. While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister I had a bit of time tolook around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresa's house. Very interesting gathering; there was a Singaporenun there she had been there for over ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered why someone from Singaporewould want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and livingthat life. There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year. They take their first vow in the fifth yearrenewable every year. In the tenth year they have to decide - final vows for eternity. So if you are not sureplease there's a way out; if you are sure then you're in the room. So the priest gave a very tough sermon andwhile he was talking I could hear the din of traffic noise outside in the streets of Calcutta. Then suddenly Iheard the call of the muezzin. Now this is a Hindu city. I told myself I thought wow what diversity in thiscountry India and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman fromAlbania should come into their midst become one of them and then when she was beatified was celebrated asan Indian on the way to canonization.China and India in that comparison- China is not India. China has a very different sense of itself; its deepinternal construction is very different. Superficially there are similarities as there is between China and the USand China and Europe. But if you look into it's deep construction it is very different. When we talk aboutChina's future and China in the 21st century how China will behave in a world community China's attitudestowards democracy towards law towards social justice. It is important first to look into this deep constructionbecause that is their nature. Naturally we should not be deterministic there is nothing inevitable in humanhistory but when we understand its nature it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and you'll be less suprisedby its actions.A few years ago the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty- to write thehistory of the Qing dynasty the Manchus from 1368 to 1644. Ever since the Han dynasty roughlycontemporaneous with the Roman Empire they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writingthe history of the previous period. So Sima Qian of the Later Han wrote of the earlier Han and the entire periodbefore that; then later on they wrote about the Later Han Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote up theYuan: The Yuan which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung. Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty whichwas the Classical Period. The last dynasty the Qing collapsed in the Republican Revolution of 1911; this isnow 2007. I think in 2003 they embarked on this project 'The Official History of the Qing dynasty'. When theformer Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently I asked him about it. He said ""we told the scholarsnot to rush this project"". I asked him how long it would take to write this history. He said it would take manyyears easily 10 years. I said ""have you collected the material?"" He said yes. I asked ""external sources?"" Hesaid yes external sources too. All the countries the Vatican European countries the whole lot; all assembled -24 official histories this would be the 26th. And Li's instruction to them was not to be too quick to drawconclusions!Now Mao Tze Tung was a revolutionary he was a great revolutionary. He overturned everything before but heknew his history he read the 24 histories and not only did he read them he annotated them. But he wrote witha terrible illegible scrawl so scholars had to decipher those scrawls. Then they wrote commentaries on hiscommentaries and now it's all published. It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own historybecause it's the same great plains the same mountains more or less the same neighbours more or less and theyhave seen the same patterns recur. So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romanticperiod of the Three Kingdoms. The first line said: ""Below heaven great movements great currents longdisunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity."" So they accept as a part of their own deep nature thatthere are cycles in their civilisation; that they have ups and downs. In recent years when you visit them youcould sense them feeling their own re-emergence it's a bit scary. In the initial years they were lacking inconfidence they asked many questions but now they know that there is an organic vitality. It is like anadolescent who watches his own development and conscious of it. I say scary because for those of us who liveon the periphery of that empire what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually to a greateror lesser degree envelope us.How do we see China? I think to begin with it's important not to try and from an intellectual viewpointtranspose our own experiences on to China because I believe it will develop according to its own logicaccording to its own DNA. It is growing now it will continue to grow it will develop its own contradictionsand one day those contradictions many years from now will lead to its own decline. So they say at thebeginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full and at the end of a dynasty the taxes arecrushing but the treasury is empty. The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeplyresistant to change. Take Confucius. Every time they had to overturn a dynasty they had to overturn Confuciusbecause Confucius justified the status quo. So throughout the 19th century whether it was the TaipingRevolution the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen; they spent their lives debunking Confucius. It reachedits final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius- no- Lin Biao together withConfucius. That was the last paroxysm. Today Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ] ""harmonioussociety"". Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back. And everywhere in the world on thepattern of Alliance Francaise the Goethe Institute the USIA they establish Confucius Institutes and thelearning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China not yet in the statecurriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties. Now why is this important?From Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin at every stage they re-interpreted Marx. They are comfortable with theyoung Marx the idea of the superstructure on the economic base the idea that politics is concentratedeconomics- that they like. But the class struggle they downplay. They talk about the Three Represents theprogressive forces the progressive elements they nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says ""harmonious society""""peaceful re-emergence"". This mindset has a certain attitude towards law has a certain attitude towards religiontowards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like to deal with each in turn.Joseph Needham many years ago I think in the 60's the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of Chinathat great encyclopedic work; he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition. In fact by his estimationthe Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West. A greater corpus of legal codification thanthe West! Surprise surprise. But the idea that the Emperor is below the law that is completely alien to theirthinking. Where did that idea come from? Well in the West you may trace it back to Hammurabi you maytrace it back to Moses to Greece to Rome. But if you trace the evolution of that DNA it goes back way backinto its early beginnings. The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point. It was not in law it wasin an idea they call '1i' which is proper conduct among human beings. They believe deep in their instincts thatlaw is only a means towards justice and that when the outcome of law is perverse then that law must beoverridden because justice proper conduct the proper relationship among human beings must takeprecedence. And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties all that the earlierhistories have summarised are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins inWestern Europe which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800;to them what are you talking about? For the Chinese laws are more like regulations means towards a largerend. Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern.Democracy is not an end in itself democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as auseful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels democracy is good. Soat the village and the township level they have democracy it is a universal franchise. They approve a slate ofcandidates and they have fierce elections fierce campaigning and those who are incompetent or arrogant ordespotic they get chucked out. But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces they say no. Nodirect democracy. Why not? Because they do not believe with their view of the universe that that is the way toproduce good government. Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope isthrough universal franchise. That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest. The ParishCouncil maybe that's ok. But the parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? That's against God's laws. Theyhave that kind of instinct embedded in them it is not Communist it is just Chinese. And they know that toomuch democracy invariably leads to 'localitis'; of favouritism towards friends relatives people who are fromthe same villages whom we have a relationship with.We have the same problem in Singapore in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today apart fromSingapore among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities the idea that ultimatecontrol of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive. You talk to Li Ka-shing you talk to RobertKwok you talk to Lim Soe Liong you talk to any of them; they will go back to the family. Why? Because theybelieve that in the end what matters at the deepest level is trust. And the family guarantees you that trust.This is also the Indian wisdom. So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta you have theParsees you have Sindhis of which Kishore is a member you have the Chettiars. They operate on the basis ofdeep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law. And because they distrust localaffiliations in two dynasties Ming and Qing no senior official could serve within 400 miles of where he wasborn. No local official to serve within 400 miles so in other words in Singapore no Singaporean can governSingapore. They go beyond that today there's almost no province in China where the provincial leader is fromthat province. Now you consider this you transpose this onto Europe it's as if routinely the President of Franceis not French. And if you are a German you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the Republic. And an Italiancannot be trusted to serve in Rome. Ancient wisdom! What is remarkable is this is accepted as legitimate. If youare Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you you do not consider it perverse or an abomination.This is part of life and in fact you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to bethere because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends.So when you talk democracy to the Chinese it is against this cultural backdrop. So what applied to the Qingdynasty the Ming dynasty they have taken a step further recently in China. They introduced even more rulesgoverning the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you wereborn. You can't stay in a ministry for too long you can't stay in a department for too long beacuse if you staytoo long you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption. Ofcourse many of these rules will still be breached and there will be scandals from time to time and they will acton those scandals. For as long as the central leadership is pristine the system can be maintained. But one daythey will become corrupt as in so many previous dynasties and a downward spiral begins. And it is verydifficult in that situation to reverse it.So I mentioned at the table that for India it's not a country that can sustain a revolution because its deepstructure would not allow for it. I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodicrevolutions. Kishore asked me when- I said well maybe in 200 years time because these are long cycles andthey expect as a matter of course that the history of the People's Republic would not be written by the People'sRepublic. It will be written by the next dynasty. Except that right now they say we shouldn't call it a dynastywe are now democrats we are a republic there is no Emperor...Well whatever term you call it it will be donemuch later.Let me now talk about their attitude towards religion. Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the upsand downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating. The Jesuits when they went toChina in the Ming dynasty hoped that they could convert the Emperor and all of China would become Catholicand a great mission would have been achieved. They never succeeded. Some of the brightest minds fromEurope went there. Matteo Ricci he corrected the Chinese calendar he repaired the clocks in the palace he sawthe throne but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China. And his tomb it's in the compound ofthe Beijing Party School today. And the church which he founded is still there today. 'Li Matou' that's what hecalled himself he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission. Then whenthe Manchus swept southwards in 1644 the missionaries thought now they had a chance ""the Manchus will bea bit more accomodating towards us we will yet Christianise China"". So if you read the despatches of themissionaries during that period the Tartar Wars they described it they were full of hope. But not a chance.They appealed to the Second Emperor Kangxi.""Can we send more missionaries?"" ""No problem"". ""Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing""""No such thing"". The Emperor imposed one condition: ""you can send as many priests as you want to China butthey must die in China they cannot leave after that"". You see instinctively the Chinese when they see theCatholic Church they see someone like themselves someone whose claim to its members is total. And forwhom that loyalty is a jealous one.Mind you they do not try to control everything; they just control the big things dogma doctrine. After that youare left on your own and you are financially independent but on the big issue of who appoints ministers andprovincial secretaries it's the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governingthis vast empire whether we're talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire. They have about thesame number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one. And overthe appointment of Bishops both seek ultimate authority. In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it. Ican anticipate the Vatican's argument that ""we are not of this realm we are of the other realm so please we arenot in conflict"". As for the Chinese leaders their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keepreligion at arm's length. Those who govern the empire they are areligious they can have private religions butin matters of their public conduct they are Confucianist. In public you are not a Catholic you are not aMuslim you are not a Buddhist. When the Jesuits went to China they were very impressed by this - that it waspossible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics. So impressed that they wrote about it andinfluenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists. It helped inspire the Frence revolution- that youcould get rid of the Church and still maintain a moral order in society.I've talked about China and law China and democracy China and religion now let me talk about China andforeign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest; about which I can only talk about generally because youare the experts in this field. I think it's very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are[Zhong Guo] the Middle Kingdom they are at the center of the Universe then there are the other 'chopstickspeoples' who are semi-Sinic. I think they consider Singapore to be semi-Sinic. Then there are those who arebeyond that realm who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians. The Mongols the Manchus theEuropeans the Americans the Indians and so on.Now all that jargon of course is not in use today. They are very civilised they will welcome you with greathospitality - lavish dinners very courteous words offering you the best of everything in the house. It remindedme of the way my mother used to teach us at home we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treatedwell the visitor has to be treated well because you are afraid of the visitor. So you always treat visitors betterthan your own family members because the visitor is capricious he can harm you so make sure you fit him in.Those who are within your authority you can always maintain order anyway. This is the way in their mindsthe universe is ordered. So I can understand why the Koreans the Japanese the Vietnamese to some extent theSingaporeans they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen manytimes before in the past. Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy I think they have becausenever in their history have they met have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power withthe US with Europe India and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed mountainswhich cannot be crossed now they are connected. So they are making adjustments.It will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics; if the Olympics become an exercise of pureChinese nationalism I think the international reaction against China will be very severe. But I think the Chinesewill be sophisticated. I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans for the Japanese so that thereis an appearance of courtesy and common humanity. They are very careful to ensure that their words fitconditions today.But let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear not out of a desire todominate. If you analyse the old tributary system those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return. Itbecame a racket. So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from [Ryukyu] in order to be able to do theChina trade because it meant a lot of money. The Chinese are fearful of foreigners. They are fearful of theRussians to the north the Muslims to the West the Indians across the Himalayas but mostly the Americansacross the Pacific. Their strategy is to keep the temperature low low profile hide the shine of your armour theshine of your sword just play the game and concentrate on economic development. Internally will they makepreparations? I have no doubt because they have a deep fear. Is their intention to dominate to conquer the waythe European powers did in the past? I don't think so. I don't think there is a great desire to turn non-Chineseinto Chinese. Maybe Korea maybe Vietnam maybe Mongolia who at various points in time were part of theirgreater empire they might consider worth civilising. But beyond that Sinicising Indians Russians? No I don'tthink they will want to do that. So as they now become stronger and more powerful I believe that while theirold nature will re-assert itself they will also be reacting to us. If they find the world a threatening place theywill develop their own responses to those threats.Quite early in the day they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia Asean. It had never been an area whichthreatened them historically. So they didn't worry about Southeast Asia as a threat. But resources sea lanesthey go through Southeast Asia. And they made a dramatic move a few years ago. Zhu Rongji was here for theASEAN-China summit. He said ""free trade agreement"". At that time when he announced it the leaders ofASEAN almost fell off their chairs. We thought of China an economic threat to us. Not as a partner. Took usalmost a year to digest the implications and to say yes let's negotiate. Step by step. And all the time China wasassuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit. When the Framework Agreement was signedby Zhu Rongji in 2002 in Phonm Penh he made two remarkable statements. He said if after 10 years theagreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia let us renegotiate it. I can never imagine theAmerican USTR or the European Trade Commissioner talking like that. I mean in a contract a deal is a dealit's settled for eternity. Then he said: ""China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia"" sohe acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl we intended to be promiscuous from thebeginning. Towards Northeast Asia I think it is very complicated because there is so much history and legacy.Towards Central Asia towards Russia they have deep fears. Towards America it has become a relationshipbound together at so many points a rupture would become more and more unthinkable. But it is going to be avery difficult relationship it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in thiscentury. If it's badly managed there will be war if it's properly managed there will be another generation ofpeace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty. In this areayou are the experts but whenever I see China and watch its moves I go back to its deep nature because it's noteasy for a country so vast with such a sense of itself to depart too much from its deep nature.

"The IndependentNovember 12 2009sbwhoeopThursday November 12 2009 8:52 AMHFYI: Murdoch makes his move to Cameron. Attack on BBC to follow. SidHas Cameron done a deal with Murdoch?By Andy McSmithLord Mandelson's attack shines spotlight on Tory leader'slinks with media mogulDavid Cameron has been accused of making a ""contract"" with Britain's biggest media company to trade political supportbefore an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win.The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson who is increasingly the public face ofGordon Brown's government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all thisweek over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit thecommercial interests of News International which owns The Sun and that the paper's aggressive support for the Tories isa pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media.Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News International's boss James Murdoch wants and what DavidCameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of ""top slicing"" theBBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regionaltelevision companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectivelyagainst Sky News which is part of the Murdoch media empire.When the policy was abandoned in September Jeremy Hunt the shadow Culture Secretary said that it was becauseenacting it might make the commercial television companies ""focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies"".There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze thelicence fee. What it will mean is that the BBC's income will be capped without the regional television companies seeingany government help which will strengthen the market position of Britain's only satellite television company Sky. ""Thiswas done for News International"" a Tory insider said yesterday. ""Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC.He doesn't want the independent companies strengthened.""In April 2008 James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after takingover as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year David Cameron announced that aConservative government would cut Ofcom down to size.Last summer James Murdoch attacked the ""abysmal record"" of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over seethe BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival singling out its ""total failure"" to stop the BBC buying the LonelyPlanet travel guides a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an ""egregious"" invasion of private enterprise by the state.Less than two months later Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust.In the same lecture Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that ""nocommercial competitor can afford"". He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey a shadow media ministerpromised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers.Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had ""effectively formed a contract overthe head incidentally of the newspaper's editor and their readers in which they are sort of bound to one another"".Speaking to the BBC's Today programme he added: ""What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election isone part of the contract and presumably what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is theother side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way this is then followedup by Sky News which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit.""This was ""absolutely categorically"" denied yesterday by The Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn who accused LordMandelson of talking ""preposterous nonsense"".The Sun which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blair's leadership announced that it wasjumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September.Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressiveattack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992general election a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan ""It was The Sun wot won it"".But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown who is blind in one eye hasadmitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes whose 20-year-old son Jamie was killed by amakeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month.A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman LordAshcroft found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Sun's attack was ""inappropriate"" compared with 23 percent who thought it was ""legitimate"".The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation from an inside source that David Cameronpersonally consulted the editor of The Sun Dominic Mohan in three separate conversations before he abandoned his""cast-iron"" promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it.Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper hascampaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of TheSun that Cameron first made his guarantee two years ago.His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack in'the Daily Mail but in TheSun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline ""Cameron's crusade for UK rights"".The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch not his father Rupert who created The Sunvirtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he ""regretted"" hisson's decision to turn against Gordon Brown ""who is a friend of mine"" but defended it on the grounds that Brown hasbeen a ""disappointment"".Yesterday The Times another Murdoch newspaper announced that its veteran political editor Phil Webster is leavingthe Commons where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. Hisreplacement Roland Watson was a friend of David Cameron's at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories.Tom Newton Dunn newly appointed as The Sun's political editor is another Old Etonian. His father Bill used to be aTory MEP but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.Independent News and Media Limited"

Victor Aloma of the Democratic Republic of Congo I am one of close aids to the formal president of Congo Democratic LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.For the military of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebles in my country, I was instructed by him (late president Kabila) to go to the Europe to purchase ARMSAND AMMUNIATION worth us$15.5(fifteen million Five Hundred Thousand us Dollars) to fight the reble groups. But when it became ap! parent  that presidentKabila has been killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his aids. I immediately decided to divert the fund ( US$15.5) into  a private security company for safekeeping. The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile  after the death of president Kabila.I need a reliable and trust worthy foreign partnerational who can assist me to clear and move this money as the beneficiary from the security company.Though we have not seen nor met each other, but I would want this transaction to be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks, this money in question is state fund as it is a deal between you and I, hence the need for secrecy considering the security implications.Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of the Netherlands, you can contact  me onthe above email addres to enable us discuss more about the deal and what  your percentage will be for assisting me.Please note that you will be required to make a brief trip to the Netherlands for inspection of the fund. I also intend to visit your country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment.I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.Kindest  Regards,COL. Victor Aloma"

"sbwhoeopWednesday August 18 2010 9:18 AMH: Interesting and relevant contribution to debate on interrelated jobs issue and China policy. Go back to your proposalson revival of manufacturing sector too. What is Bill's program on lm jobs you mentioned? If they won't listen he shouldsimply do an op-ed. SidDoes Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get SoMany Things Wrong?Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington DC.Wednesday 18 August 2010 04:04Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance tospeak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe thathe is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to thesesenior economic policy makers.Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful thanwhat can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes theusual cliches with the usual lack of thought. In doing so he gets both the story of the recent past and thepresent seriously wrong.Starting with the past he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China togive ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-terminvestments in new growth engines.""The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part dueto the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order tomaintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade the Clinton administration had alsotried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and othercountries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a largeand growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demandpreventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housingbubble) until just before the crash.There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected bythe Bush tax cuts. In other words neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to dowith our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Giventhe weakness of demand through most of the decade these expenses could have been easily filled by domesticproduction without borrowing from abroad.Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty"" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board ChairmanBen Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctanceto hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker as employers sought to meet theirdemand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn but the increasein hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still farshorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.Later he tells readers:""America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion therise of cloud computing social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads andiF'hones technology is destroying older less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than everwhile spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.""This is a great story -- social networking is soaring IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidencewhatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand forless educated workers? If so this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise readersmight think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level)coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade implies a reduced demand for the labor of highlyeducated workers as well as less educated workers.Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:""There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs thatcan pay workers $40 an hour coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs overtheir global competitors. There is no other way.""We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentileon the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredibleaccomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:""Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. TheGermans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness andworker flexibility while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.""Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy like work sharing and some that haven'tbut its past as the ""sick man of Europe"" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germanyalways ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buyingits goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7.5_percept not hugely different than its current 7.0percent rate.The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis inspite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack ofdemand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policygreater fiscal stimulus or increased exports due to a falling dollar there is no reason to believe that theeconomy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence thatincreased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don'thave access to documents like the Medicare trustees report which imply that U.S. health care costs will becontrolled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong but it seems that itwould have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course if we have not fixed our health care systemwe can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.If Friedman's intention was to scare us he succeeded. After all if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies then we can expect some very had times ahead."

"Dear friend,Greetings, I am Mr.Henry Okoye the Account Manager of Late Mr.  Morris Thompson in Standard Trust Bank Regional Office in Victoria island, here in Lagos.However I got your contact through the International web directory.I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and private.Recently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued USD35,000,000.00 (Thirty Five Million Dollars only)that belongs to one of our late Customer who died in a plane crash .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American great  industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who  unfortunately lost his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31  2000,including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more news about the crash on  visiting this site which I got during my  investigation;http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/andhttp://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.htmlThe fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development.The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for five years, it will be for feited no the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund. In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary.s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr.  Morris Thompson.In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank,this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediatelyto receive this fund, even an empty a/c can also serve for this purpose.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as gratification for your assisting us, and the remaining 60% will be for me and my partners.What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have in my possession, all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish the operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free.Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish. Find in the attachment of my Family Picture, to proof who I am.I await your Urgent Responce, Regrads,Mr.Henry Okoye"

"The writer is someone who has worked with Afghan women in developing small businesses in Afghanistan and is doing abook about the experience.She went back to Afghanistan for the conference that women had over the weekend and wrote the article that followsfor today's Daily Beast.Soraya mentioned here is one of our Women of Courage. Gayle (the writer) told me in a separate email that De Misturawas very sympathetic and said they should be consulted that the current documents are working documents and hepledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up. He also told them that he was very impressed thatthey had organized themselves in this 2-day conference to be able to play a more effective role. Zakhilwal was graciousbut said they were adequately consulted. So it goes.Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday's Kabul Conference butAfghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will rollback their hard-fought rights.As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference Afghan women are delivering a plain message togovernment and international officials: Women's voices should be heard.""We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference we have not been consulted"" said Soraya Pakzad founderof a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and-answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan deMistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. ""We want to be involved in policy-making. We don't want ourpresence to be purely symbolic.""""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations oraccords.""The Kabul Conference is in part built on symbolism. A follow-up to January's London Conference the gathering marksthe first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors a decision that is intended to showcase the transitionfrom foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descendupon the Afghan capital which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seenSunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival.Discussions will center around five topics including economic development agriculture governance and security. Thegoal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of thecountry's political and economic direction.Although it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment long under-resourced and beset by allegations ofcorruption will be able to take the reins from its international donors there is no question that Afghan ownership is thedirection in which things are moving on the political economic and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feelthe stakes for this week's meeting are so high particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that mightthreaten women's rights.""After the Kabul Conference no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations andnegotiations"" said Orzala Ashraf an Afghan human rights activist. ""This is very important for us to get a serious andhonest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not besilenced.""Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view Tuesday's talks are their last best shot at speaking out about theirconcerns with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at thetable. In another show of support Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesdaymorning with a group of women leaders.Regardless of this high-profile backing many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything asidefrom more paper and more unkept promises.""Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments"" said SelayGhaffar an Afghan Women's Network board member. ""We want things to change.""And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul men or women are paying attention to yet another gathering todiscuss their future.""Women in the provinces don't even know about this"" said Zainab a young math teacher from Helmand province. ""Iwould say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on.""Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn't enough to make a difference. And they saythey fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban particularly in southern Afghanistan.""This is very dangerous"" said Shahida Hussain a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a communityorganizer during the Taliban years. ""We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fearwar again.""Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters but only if they respect women'sconstitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.""Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan"" said thewomen in a statement at the end of their meeting. ""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in anypeace negotiations or accords.""In the meantime women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference callsembassy meetings and lunchtime gatherings two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.And in a small victory for women international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that womenwould be more involved going forward.""I agree you were not consulted"" said da Mistura appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister who only a fewmoments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. ""As usual we have been paying lip service toyou and we are all at fault for that.""Gayle Tzemach Lemmon covered presidential politics as a producer at ABC News in Washington. Since 2005 she hasbeen reporting on women entrepreneurs starting small and medium-sized businesses in post-conflict economies such asAfghanistan Bosnia and Rwanda. She is currently working on a book scheduled for 2010 publication by HarperCollinsabout a young Afghan entrepreneur whose business supported her family and community during the Taliban years."

Fyi - happy to give more context.
Here's the update pieced together from various sources:Starting at around 3 pm Friday Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and ArleneFoster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussioncontinued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Herrelationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct treating them as equal colleagues.)Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talksare. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to pushon today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide towind up today and resume on Monday.Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically withinthe DUP but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised toomuch. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades adding that Robinson has alsomoved.The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader NigalDodds. Logistically such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades frameworkrequires consultation legislation and implementation.The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues such as Irishlanguage act N-S bodies etc while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.
